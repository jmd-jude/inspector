of individuals across academic medicine, including more than 201,000 full-time faculty members, 
97,000 medical students, 158,000 resident physicians, and 60,000 graduate students and postdoctoral 
researchers in the biomedical sciences. Following a 2022 merger, the Alliance of Academic Health 
Centers International broadened participation in the AAMC by 70 international academic health centers 
throughout five regional offices across the globe. Learn more at aamc.org. 
Important Notice
The information in this book is based on the most recent data provided by AAMC-member medical 
schools at the request of the AAMC.
We edited and, in some instances, condensed the material to meet space limitations. In 
compiling this edition, we made every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy and timeliness 
of the information, and, except where noted, the information was updated as of summer 2024. 
All the information, however, especially figures on tuition and expenses, is subject to change 
and is nonbinding for the medical schools listed and the AAMC. All medical schools listed in this 
edition, as with other educational institutions, are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin.
Such laws include Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 
1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age 
Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended. For the most current and complete information about 
costs, official policies, procedures, and other matters, please contact individual schools.
In applying to U.S. or Canadian medical schools, applicants need not go through any commercial 
agencies. The AAMC does not endorse any organization or entity that purports to help applicants 
gain admission to medical school, other than undergraduate premedical advisors and medical 
school admissions officers.
AAMC Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
The AAMC’s mission is to serve and lead the academic medicine community to improve the health of 
people everywhere. As the U.S. population ages and grows more diverse, understanding the benefits 
of diversity, equity, and inclusion becomes critical to addressing the health of the nation, especially in 
light of persistent health care disparities. The AAMC’s commitment spans more than three decades, 
demonstrated by programs, advocacy, research, and leadership engagement activities that promote 
diversity, equity, and inclusion in medicine and biomedical research. Information about AAMC 
initiatives is available at aamc.org/diversity.

The AAMC works through many avenues to support medical education and help aspiring physicians 
succeed in their path to medical school. We created this guide to serve as a resource for students 
considering a career as a physician. Each chapter explains one aspect of the medical school admission 
process, and each is carefully reviewed every year by content experts at the AAMC.
You may choose to read this book cover to cover, or you may prefer to skip ahead to chapters most 
relevant to where you are in the application process. Here are some tips to get the most out of this guide.
Skim the table of contents before you begin reading.
Not everyone takes the same path or is in the same place when they use this guide. You may want to 
read the chapters in the order that most relates to where you are in the process and what you need 
to know to move forward.
Use and update the chapter worksheets.
At the end of each chapter, you’ll find a worksheet that can help you with your medical school 
application. Topics include tracking your volunteer experiences, finding people to write your 
letters of evaluation, and determining the right time to take the MCAT ® exam. You may want 
to complete these worksheets after you read the chapter or hold onto them until you’re at that 
phase of the application process. You can print copies of the worksheets or complete fillable PDFs.
We encourage you to share your work with your prehealth advisor as you complete the 
worksheets. You should have an advisor or mentor to help guide you through this process. 
Find out more about the benefits of working with an advisor in Chapter 2, “Undergraduate 
Preparation.” If you do not have a prehealth advisor at your school, you can find one at NAAHP.org.
Look through the data in this book to understand the national picture.
Part of being a well-prepared applicant is knowing more about the national applicant and acceptance 
data. While every applicant is different, and every medical school accepts applicants with a range of 
scores and experiences, it can be helpful to see how you compare with other applicants across the 
country. This will help you to decide, along with your prehealth advisor, when you’re ready to apply to 
medical school. The data in this book comes directly from the AAMC Data Warehouse, the AAMC Data 
Book, the American Medical College Application Service® (AMCAS®), the MCAT, and surveys conducted 
with entering and graduating medical students such as the Graduation Questionnaire (GQ) and the 
Matriculating Student Questionnaire (MSQ). The data is comprehensively updated each year with the 
most current information available at the time of production. Because this information comes directly 
from the source, you can trust that it is the most up-to-date and accurate information available. For 
more information, you can refer to the AAMC FACTS tables.
Check out the Medical School Admission Requirements™ (MSAR ®) site when you’re ready to look 
at individual schools.
One of the most important decisions you’ll make is where to apply to medical school. The AAMC’s 
Medical School Admission Requirements™ (MSAR ®) website provides the most comprehensive, 
up-to-date information and data. When you’re ready to start researching medical schools, tap 
into this powerful online database of information on U.S. and Canadian medical schools and 
baccalaureate-MD programs. As the gold standard for admission requirement information, this is 
the only comprehensive resource of accurate and current data directly from the MCAT program, 
the AMCAS program, and medical school admissions offices. Your subscription allows you to 
search, sort, and save information.

A note about MD versus DO programs: This guidebook explains the process of preparing for and applying 
to medical doctor (MD) programs accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME®). 
You may have heard of osteopathic medicine programs that grant doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) 
degrees. DO and MD programs have many similarities; both types of physicians are fully certified to 
practice medicine in the United States after passing board examinations. For more information about 
DO-granting schools and admission requirements, consult the American Association of Colleges of 
Osteopathic Medicine.

CHAPTER 1
So . . . You Want to Be a Doctor
Aaron Teng-Hei Hui
Albert Einstein College of Medicine 
Class of 2026
Do you remember when you first decided to pursue medicine? I believe that 
within each of us lies an innate desire to make a difference, to touch lives, and 
to bring healing to those who need it. I wager that it is this profound yearning 
that has led you not only to embark on but also to embrace this journey — a 
journey that will shape your life as well as also countless other lives in the years 
and decades to come. 
 
However, make no mistake: This journey will be difficult. Medicine, after all, is not just a 
profession; it’s a calling that both demands and requires steadfast dedication, resilience, and a 
relentless pursuit of new knowledge. It is a field that constantly challenges the very limits of our 
understanding and often pushes the boundary of what is possible. It requires a curious mind, a 
compassionate heart, and a spirit that refuses to yield to adversity. 
 
Yet, while the path ahead will be arduous, remember that you possess a unique set of skills and 
qualities that cannot be defined simply by test scores and GPA alone. Your intellectual capacity, 
honed by your studies, will equip you to comprehend the complexities of the human body and 
begin to unravel the mysteries of disease. Never forget that it is your empathy and your ability to see 
beyond the symptoms and embrace the human behind the illness that define you as a physician. 
 
In a world sometimes limited by hurried consultations and fragmented care, take the time to 
listen to your future patients, to understand their fears and hopes, and to offer solace in moments 
of vulnerability. May empathy guide your steps and skill guide your hands — and may your heart 
remain attuned to those you will serve. The world eagerly awaits your healing.
Tomorrow’s Doctors, Tomorrow’s Cures®
Many medical school applicants realize their dream of becoming a doctor at an early age. A recent 
AAMC survey shows that just over half of all medical students who responded to the survey chose 
a medical career before they set foot in college — and one in five made the choice before they 
even started high school (refer to Figure 1.1).
Whether you have always known you wanted to be a doctor or are just starting to consider 
the idea, being a physician is an extremely rewarding profession. A career in medicine offers 
numerous opportunities to make a real difference in the lives of countless people.
As a doctor, you are likely to see new life come into the world or provide comfort to those about to 
leave it. Or you may choose to help build the future of medicine by educating the next generation 
of physicians. Perhaps you will dedicate yourself to discovering new cures for devastating diseases.
3

Whichever direction you follow, you will play a role in reducing or eliminating people’s pain and 
suffering, improving their quality of life, and providing invaluable service to your local community 
and maybe the country as a whole.

Your Medical Career Driven by Your Interests
Another benefit of the field is that you can choose from many and varied ways to practice. From clinical 
practice to biomedical research, from public health to medical education — the choices are plentiful. 
Most students change or refine their specialty preferences as they gain experience and knowledge 
in medical school. You can find more information about the number of U.S. medical students who 
provided a specialty preference in Table A1, “Continuity of Specialty Preference,” in the Matriculating 
Student Questionnaire (MSQ) and the 2023 Graduation Questionnaire. If your interests change with 
time and experience, medicine — because of its emphasis on lifelong learning and ties to research and 
technological developments — will provide you with opportunities to hone your skills and re-orient 
your practice. Here are some examples of possible careers:
 • The satisfaction of long-term patient relationships is one attraction of family medicine and internal 
medicine, where the bulk of time is spent in direct contact with patients. Physicians who work 
under the umbrella of “primary care” often care for entire families and enjoy the challenges that 
come from treating a diverse population with varied backgrounds and conditions.
 • Other physicians, like cardiologists, ophthalmologists, dermatologists, endocrinologists, and other 
specialists, develop and apply detailed knowledge about the intricacies of a single organ or system.
 • Physicians interested in scientific exploration with the desire to break new ground in medical 
knowledge can be found in the nation’s private and public laboratories and research institutions.
 • Those with a commitment to social justice and an interest in fulfilling the health care needs of the 
underserved and disadvantaged can meet those challenges in urban and rural clinics, in public 
health, or as medical missionaries.
 • Careers in general surgery  often suit people who have a desire to see immediate results of 
their interventions. Plastic and reconstructive surgery  draws others with artistic skills and 
aesthetic interests.
4 | Chapter 1: So ... You Want to Be a Doctor

• Those interested in mind-body interactions and the emotional lives of their patients might find 
a home in neurology or psychiatry.
 • The fast pace of medicine draws some to work as emergency physicians or trauma surgeons.
 • Others motivated by national defense may use their skills as flight surgeons or in military 
medicine.
 • The economic and public policy aspects of health care  guide some physicians to think tanks 
and health-related organizations, as well as to serve in the legislative and executive branches 
of government.
 • Those fascinated by issues facing groups of patients with age-defined illnesses and problems 
— from the risks in infancy and early childhood to the challenges of older life — find fulfillment 
as pediatricians and geriatricians.
 • Assisting patients in overcoming complex fertility and gestational problems is the hallmark of 
specialists in reproductive endocrinology as well as obstetrics and gynecology.
 • Those dedicated to reducing the incidence of birth defects and inherited diseases might find 
their calling in medical genetics.
 • The detection, prevention, and eradication of injury and disease draw people to the fields of 
preventive medicine and epidemiology.
Once you enter medical school, you’ll start actively learning about these and the myriad other career 
options and considering where you best fit. This is addressed further in Chapter 3, in the section 
“Determining How You Want to Practice Medicine.”
What About the Future?
As long as we’re looking ahead, let’s look way ahead. In 5, 10, 15 years, what will medicine look like?  
 One thing is certain — the face of medicine changes continually. A good example of this is the 
growing prevalence of women in medicine. In the 1976-1977 academic year, women made up just 
24.7% of all medical school matriculants. Compare that with 2023-2024, when they made up more 
than half — 55.4% — of the entering class, according to the AAMC Applicant Matriculant File.
Look back one generation, and you can see many new fields have emerged.
 • In the early 1980s, a new — and fatal — illness was taking hold that nobody could identify. We now 
know it well: AIDS. Infectious disease is currently a large medical subspecialty, and, as a result, 
significant advances have been made in extending the lives of those infected with HIV.
 • In the last few decades, minimally invasive surgery, in which surgeons carry out precise procedures — 
sometimes with the assistance of a robot — became increasingly popular. Such surgeries are currently 
used in procedures on the lungs, the esophagus, the prostate, the uterus, and kidneys. Through 
surgeries like these, patients benefit from smaller incisions, lower risks of complications, shorter 
hospital stays, less pain, and speedier recoveries.
 • In personalized medicine, a career path unavailable to the previous generation, technology allows 
physicians to identify mutated genes and alert patients about their predisposition to a specific 
disease. (The next step — actually treating diseases with genes — is on the horizon.)
 • Some more established fields have evolved to take on new applications. Radiology, for example, 
is no longer about just reading X-rays. Radiologists can now perform surgery as part of 
interventional radiology.
5 | Chapter 1: So ... You Want to Be a Doctor

Even more exciting is what lies ahead: gene therapy, portable medical records, distance surgery, 
and focused medication. The possibilities for advancement in medical research are limitless.
 • Early tests of gene therapy have been especially promising for cystic fibrosis, by transporting 
the correct cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene via a harmless virus  
or liposome.
 • Similarly, research is underway in pharmacogenomics, a field that uses patients’ genetic codes 
to develop tailored treatments. For example, if a patient’s genes fit a certain type of cancer code, 
the physician will prescribe the “matching” pharmaceutical developed to destroy cells with that 
code and will know — rather than hope — the treatment is likely to work. Pharmacogenomics 
is still in its infancy, with most forms of tailored drugs used in oncology, but studies are 
progressing in other areas, including cardiology, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders.
 • Also, in development is focused preventive care, which uses genetic diagnosis to identify to 
a very specific degree how likely a patient is to develop a certain disease or condition — and 
prevents that development before it has a chance to begin.
 • Other advances may be administrative in nature; for example, the days of hunting down medical 
records are ending. One possibility being explored is a portable medical records system, or a 
national online database of individual health records. Everyone would carry a smart card (or have 
an implanted microchip) allowing physicians easy access to medical records. This technology 
would reduce errors, make files readily available, minimize or eliminate delays, and eliminate the 
experience of having repeated — that is, unnecessary — tests.
Workforce Issues
Above all, know this: Whatever specialty you choose, your services as a physician will be needed.
According to a study commissioned by the AAMC, there will be a shortage of 13,500 to 86,000 
physicians by 2036. The shortage is being driven in large part by the rapid expansion of the number 
of Americans age 65 or over. Our doctors are getting older, too. Nearly one-third of today’s physicians 
will be of retirement age in the next decade, just as more Americans need care. A continued 
demand for physicians and other medical professionals is projected.
Figure 1.2 illustrates the growing physician shortages between 2021 and 2036.

However, the shortages will be experienced unevenly, and some geographic areas will feel the 
effect more strongly than others. With that in mind, you might consider these trends as you think 
about the direction you’d like your career to take.
Primary Care 
Although the nation is facing an overall shortage of physicians, many people are particularly concerned 
about the growing deficit of primary care doctors. Within the overall shortage of physicians, experts 
expect a shortfall of between 20,200 and 40,400 primary care physicians by 2036. To encourage U.S. 
medical school graduates to pursue a career in primary care, the federal government and many state 
governments offer a variety of scholarship and loan repayment programs. You may want to explore the 
rewards this type of career offers, including the satisfaction that comes from delivering comprehensive 
care and long-term relationships with your patients.
Underserved Areas 
The impact of this shortage is expected to be greatest in underserved areas — the urban and 
rural areas where health care is already scarce. If you choose to serve in a community designated 
as a Health Professional Shortage Area by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 
you may be able to take advantage of a federal program — the National Health Service Corps — 
that offers scholarships and loan repayment. According to the AAMC’s 2023 MSQ, about 32.2% of 
entering students planned to work in a primarily underserved area, and more than half of entering-
student survey participants hadn’t yet decided where they wanted to work. (Learn more about this 
program in Chapter 10, “You Can Afford Medical School.”)
A More Collaborative Approach
As Congress explores various scenarios for health care reform, one thing is nearly certain: Given the 
projected shortage of physicians, we will need to develop new models of health care delivery that 
make better, more efficient use of all health care professionals — not just doctors.
That means you can expect to work within a more collaborative, shared environment, in which 
a team of health care providers — including physician’s assistants and nurse practitioners, for 
example — work in tandem. Exactly how that will play out is still in development, but the goal is 
to create a more efficient system, increase patient satisfaction, and, ultimately, improve health 
outcomes.
A collaborative approach to health care delivery is instilled beginning in the early years of medical 
education. Read more about the use of small-group discussions, problem-based learning, and 
other educational models in Chapter 3, “Your Medical School Years: The Education Process.”
Immediate Steps That Lie Ahead
That’s the future — or at least what we expect. Right now, though, you’re undoubtedly more focused 
on the short-term goal of getting into medical school.
So, what is the process for applying to medical school? What lies ahead?
Let’s be candid. Getting into medical school isn’t easy. (But it’s definitely doable — as the more than 
97,903 students currently enrolled can testify!) You will need to prepare for and take the MCAT exam, 
select schools to apply to, complete the application, write a personal statement, gather letters of 
evaluation, secure your undergraduate transcripts, and interview. Then you will wait for notices of 
acceptance and make your final decision. If you’re not accepted, you’ll need to evaluate your options 
and figure out what to do next. All of this will be covered in the following chapters.
7 | Chapter 1: So ... You Want to Be a Doctor

But first, you can take many steps to make yourself a more attractive candidate to admissions 
committees. From taking the necessary courses to working effectively with your prehealth advisor 
to participating in extracurricular and volunteer activities — there’s a lot you can do now. (The next 
chapter focuses on your undergraduate preparation.)
A Note for Career Changers or Gap-Year Applicants
If a year or more has passed since you graduated from college, you’re not alone. Nearly three-quarters 
(73.2%) of matriculating medical students indicated in the AAMC MSQ that there was a gap between their 
college graduation and matriculation to medical school of at least a year. Medical schools do not see a 
break between the end of college and beginning of medical school as a weakness or negative attribute. 
In fact, what you’ve experienced or accomplished during this time may enhance your application and 
qualifications significantly.
We’ll provide tips and things to consider throughout this book to help guide you through the application 
and preparation process. We know there may be some variation in how you’ll need to prepare yourself and 
compile the different components of your application now that you’re no longer on campus.

Megan Scharner
Medical University of South Carolina College of Medicine  
Class of 2026
I remember going to grab a cup of coffee with a friend while I was 
navigating the medical school admissions process. Mid-conversation, she 
asked, “Do you shower every day?” She shared that her daily shower was that 
one, easy, consistent thing that grounded her — that when she prioritized 
her daily shower, she was the best version of herself. “What’s your shower?” 
she asked me.
For me, some quiet time in the morning with my coffee and a crossword puzzle — even if it’s just a 
few minutes, it helps me to get in the right headspace for the day ahead. It allows me time to reflect 
and identify my goals for the day. And if I don’t prioritize my time for this daily ritual, I feel it. No matter 
what your shower is, it is imperative to identify and prioritize it in your daily life as you embark on your 
medical school journey. Regardless of your background, prior career, gap years or lack thereof, the 
unique path to and through medical school is both a privilege and a challenge. The power of a daily 
grounding practice, no matter what it is, will help you to put your best foot forward for both you and 
your future patients.
Premedical Preparation 
College coursework plays a major role in your preparation for medical school. Your major field of 
study, the mastery of specific scientific principles, and advanced coursework all contribute to that 
preparation. Let’s take a closer look at each of these.
Choice of Major
Contrary to what many college students believe, there is no such thing as the “best” major. In 
fact, no medical school requires a specific major of its applicants. That’s because admissions 
committee members know that students develop the essential skills of acquiring and 
synthesizing information through a wide variety of academic disciplines and should therefore be 
free to select whichever major they find interesting and challenging.
Even so, many premedical students choose to major in a scientific discipline. If that’s the direction 
you’re heading in, and you’re doing so because you are fascinated by science and believe that such a 
major will be the foundation for a variety of career options, great. If you’re doing so because you believe 
it will enhance your chances for admission, think again.

Notes:  The means and SDs of MCAT scores are calculated based on data from applicants who applied with MCAT scores (each year, approximately 2% 
of individuals apply without MCAT scores). Specifically, 51,423 applicants and 22,262 matriculants in 2023 were included in the calculations. Only the 
most recent MCAT score is used for individuals who took the exam more than once. The means and SDs of UGPA are calculated based on applicants 
with available GPA data. Specifically, 52,317 applicants and 22,800 matriculants in 2023 were included in the calculations. Each academic year includes 
applicants and matriculants that applied to enter medical school in the fall of the given year. For example, academic year 2023-2024 represents the 
applicants and matriculants that applied to enter medical school during the 2023 application cycle.

Admissions committees welcome students whose intellectual curiosity leads them to a wide 
variety of disciplines.
And no . . . you won’t be at a disadvantage if you choose to major in English, for example, rather 
than biology. You may be surprised to learn that there is very little difference in median total MCAT 
scores among those who major in the humanities, social sciences, and biological sciences. Table 
2.1 shows that students from many different majors are accepted to medical school, as long as 
they have the basic science preparation needed.

College students take advantage of a variety of programs to prepare for medical school and 
a career in medicine. Table 2.2 shows the percentage of students who participated in several 
popular programs in 2023.

Scientific Preparation
Still, medical schools recognize the importance of a strong foundation in mathematics and the natural 
sciences — biology, chemistry, and physics — and most schools have established minimum course 
requirements for admission. These courses usually represent about one-third of the credit hours 
needed for degree completion (leaving room for applicants to pursue a broad spectrum of college 
majors, as shown in Figure 2.1).

12 | Chapter 2: Undergraduate Preparation

Many medical schools have progressed to competency-based admissions, meaning they do not require 
specific courses. For those that do require courses, schools typically expect that their entering students 
will have mastered basic scientific principles by successfully completing one academic year (two 
semesters or three quarters) each of biology, physics, general chemistry, and organic chemistry, including 
adequate laboratory experiences. Increasingly, biochemistry is strongly recommended by schools, too.
Figure 2.1 presents information about the undergraduate majors 
of all medical school applicants to entering classes for the years 
2019-2024. Over the past five years, more than half of all applicants 
reported undergraduate biological science majors, while the 
remainder reported a variety of majors, including the humanities, 
mathematics and statistics, physical sciences, social sciences, and 
other health sciences, as well as a broad “other” category.
The proportions of these different majors have remained relatively 
constant over time, despite annual fluctuations in the number of 
applicants.
Although only a few medical schools require applicants to 
complete a specific course in mathematics, all schools appreciate 
that mathematical competence provides a strong foundation for 
understanding basic sciences. A working knowledge of statistics 
helps students fully grasp medical literature. Many medical 
schools therefore recommend coursework in mathematics and 
statistics in addition to the science courses named above. Table 
2.3 gives an overview of the most common courses required or 
recommended by medical schools.
AP, IB, and CLEP Courses
If you intend to apply college credit earned through advanced placement (AP), international 
baccalaureate (IB), and college-level examination placement (CLEP)  to meet premedical 
requirements, you should be aware that some medical schools have requirements about the 
use of such credit. Please review the MSAR website and the websites of medical schools you’re 
interested in for more information.
Competencies Versus Courses
Finally, for those of you reading this in your early years of college (or in high school), note that medical 
schools are increasingly defining their prerequisites by competencies rather than by courses. This 
comes about because, as a collaborative report between the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
(HHMI) and the AAMC points out, the scientific knowledge medical schools seek in their applicants 
can be obtained in a variety of courses as opposed to specific ones. In other words, a student might 
be able to develop and apply knowledge about chemistry principles in a zoology class or about 
statistics in a sociology class.
Advanced Coursework
Although upper-level science coursework may not be required by every medical school, it’s 
usually a good idea to show you have challenged yourself academically. Successfully completing 
advanced courses demonstrates science proficiencies and ultimately strengthens your preparation 
for medical school. Taking science courses that simply duplicate basic content, however, is not 
recommended. But don’t think that all your upper-level courses must be STEM-based (science, 
technology, engineering, and math). Practicing physicians often suggest that premedical students 
take advantage of what might be their final opportunity for formal study in nonscience areas

13 | Chapter 2: Undergraduate Preparation

and take elective courses in subjects of interest, such as music, art, history, and literature. Medical 
schools also look for applicants with rich and varied coursework and experiences. Beyond that, 
medical schools encourage honors courses, independent study, and research work by premedical 
students. Activities such as these demonstrate in-depth scholarly exploration and the presence of 
the lifelong-learning skills essential to a career in medicine.
Career Changers and Gap-Year Students: Not All Coursework Is “Evergreen”
It’s important for applicants who have had a significant break between completing coursework 
and applying to medical school to check with the schools or look at the MSAR website for details 
on the oldest date coursework can be accepted. This is especially important for core premedical 
requirements, though some schools may waive the requirement for individual courses based on 
an applicant’s professional experience (for instance, an applicant whose current work shows a 
high level of competency in a medically related area).
Some applicants who need to complete numerous courses do so via postbaccalaureate 
premedical programs for career changers or for those who need to enhance their academic 
record.
Postbaccalaureate information is available in the AAMC’s free postbaccalaureate database.
Premed Competencies
The Premed Competencies were developed to highlight the knowledge, skills, values, and attributes that 
the medical education community thinks are fundamental for entering medical students to successfully 
carry out their roles and responsibilities and learn and develop into future physicians. The competencies 
fall into three categories: Professional Competencies: Thinking and Reasoning, and Science. 
The AAMC-HHMI report Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians proposes scientific competencies 
for future medical school graduates and undergraduate students who want to pursue a career in 
medicine, including:
 • Both the knowledge of and ability to apply basic principles of mathematics and statistics, physics, 
chemistry, biochemistry, and biology to human health and disease
 • The ability to demonstrate observational and analytical skills
 • The ability to apply those skills and principles to biological situations
These scientific competencies have been incorporated into the AAMC’s Thinking and Reasoning 
Competencies and Science Competencies.
Personal Attributes
As the Premed Competencies suggest, academic and scientific accomplishments alone are 
not sufficient preparation for medical school. While intellectual capacity is obviously important 
to being a successful physician, so are other attributes that signify the ability to develop and 
maintain effective relationships with patients, work collaboratively with team members, act 
ethically and compassionately, and master the art of medicine in many other ways.
The AAMC publication Learning Objectives for Medical Student Education: Guidelines for Medical 
Schools describes the personal attributes required of a physician. While making note that graduating 
medical students must be knowledgeable about medicine and skillful in its application, the 
publication also emphasizes it is vital for students to:
 • Make ethical decisions
 • Act with compassion, respect, honesty, and integrity
14 | Chapter 2: Undergraduate Preparation

• Work collaboratively with team members
 • Advocate on behalf of one’s patients
 • Be sensitive to potential conflicts of interest
 • Be able to recognize one’s own limits
 • Be dedicated to continually improving one’s knowledge and abilities
 • Appreciate the complex nonbiological determinants of poor health
 • Be aware of community and public health issues
 • Be able to identify risk factors for disease
 • Be committed to early identification and treatment of diseases
 • Accept responsibility for making scientifically based medical decisions
 • Be willing to advocate for the care of the underserved
Chances are, some of the most valuable knowledge and skills as a physician you didn’t learn in a 
classroom. These characteristics may be nurtured throughout your college years (and, as you will 
see in Chapter 8, are among the attributes admissions officers seek when admitting applicants to 
their programs). You don’t need formal programs to learn how to be a kind, empathetic physician. 
You have already had and will continue to have an abundance of opportunities to develop these 
qualities through your interactions with friends, classmates, and others while in college and 
through your life, work, and volunteer experiences.
Extracurricular Activities Related to Medicine
Your undergraduate years offer opportunities to become involved in a wide range of extracurricular 
activities. Ideally, at least a few of them should involve the medical field. Experience in a health 
care setting, such as volunteering at shelters or clinics or in other environments to care for ill or 
elderly people in your community; participating in basic or clinical research efforts; working as an 
emergency medical technician; shadowing a physician; and supporting people in a sexual assault 
crisis center, emergency room, or social service agency are all types of activities recommended to 
those considering a career in medicine.
These pursuits give you the chance to learn more about the medical profession and yourself. You 
will, for example, be able to:
 • Explore different interests
 • Experience and evaluate different working environments
 • Understand the nature of medical practice and the daily demands placed on physicians
 • Assess your ability to communicate and empathize with people from different backgrounds 
and cultures
 • Evaluate your willingness to put others’ needs before your own
While this self-analysis can help you decide if a career in medicine is right for you, your involvement 
with clinical or research activities also helps demonstrate your interests to admissions committees. 
It shows that you have explored various aspects of the medical field.
Admissions committees evaluate your experiences using at least three different criteria, and greater 
value is assigned to some types of pursuits than others. Specifically, admissions committees look at 
the length of time you’ve invested, the depth of the experience, and lessons learned in relation to 
any particular activity. This means a single, daylong blood drive or one-time shadowing experience 
is often perceived as less enlightening than semester or yearlong commitments. By the same token, 
15 | Chapter 2: Undergraduate Preparation

active participation in an activity is viewed as more instructive than passive participation (such as 
observation).
Most importantly, admissions committees want to know what students learned from their experiences. 
Be prepared to address questions about your community, clinical, or research experiences in your 
application materials (which will be discussed in Chapter 7, “Applying to Medical School”).
Do not approach your extracurricular activities with the idea of “checking off” a wide range of 
pursuits to impress admissions committees. Three or four in-depth experiences from which you 
gained valuable lessons are far more significant — and telling — to admissions officers than dozens 
of short-term involvements.
Prehealth Advisors
Fortunately, you’re not on your own when it comes to preparing for medical school. Valuable resources 
are available to you — some likely right on campus, including your prehealth advisor.
Depending on the individual school, prehealth advisors work on a full- or part-time basis and may be a 
faculty member (often in a science department), a staff member in the office of an academic dean or 
the career center, the director or staff in an advising office for preprofessional students, or a physician 
in part-time practice. Advisors belong to organizations such as the National Association of Advisors 
for the Health Professions (NAAHP) that assist them in their work — and help them help you. If your 
school does not have a prehealth advisor, contact the NAAHP about getting a member volunteer 
to help you. Visit NAAHP’s Find an Advisor site for more information. You can find each school’s 
admission requirements on the Required Premedical Coursework and Competencies page, and you 
can use the MSAR website to view each school’s admission requirements profile. You can always reach 
out to medical school admissions staff if you have specific questions about admission requirements 
or policies. Be sure to check the medical school’s website first, though, to see if the information is 
available there.
Services Provided
The support provided by prehealth advisors varies from school to school. Contact your school’s advisor 
to find out which services and resources are offered.
Generally, services fall into five categories:
 • Academics. Advisors are well-informed about premedical coursework on their campuses and 
often work with faculty at their schools to develop suitable academic programs for premed 
students. They collaborate with campus academic staff to design study, reading skills, and 
test-preparation workshops; offer tutoring programs; and inform students they advise about 
regional and national programs likely to be of interest.
 • Clinical and research experiences. Advisors often work with advisory groups composed of college 
and medical school teaching and research faculty and community clinicians. They help applicants 
identify part-time jobs, volunteer positions, and opportunities for independent study credit in local 
laboratories and offices.
 • Advising and support. Advisors help students pursue realistic goals and maximize their potential, 
both meeting with them individually and providing group opportunities for students to meet 
with one another. Advisors often establish peer advising and mentoring programs and are 
particularly sensitive to the needs of students who are underrepresented in medicine or the first 
in their family to attend college.
16 | Chapter 2: Undergraduate Preparation

• Assistance to student organizations. Advisors coordinate the activities of local and national 
organizations that serve premed students by planning programs, identifying funding sources, 
and arranging for campus visits from admissions and financial aid officers.
 • Sharing resources. Advisors disseminate publications and other resources from relevant 
organizations, including the AAMC and NAAHP, to meet students’ need for timely and 
pertinent information. In addition, advisors provide access to web-based content on health 
careers programs and educational financing; distribute information about local, regional, 
national, and international research and service opportunities; and stock a library of 
publications related to medical school and medical education.
A Wide Range of Guidance
A prehealth advisor may assist you in many ways, including:
 • Identifying courses that satisfy premedical requirements
 • Determining a sequence for completing those courses
 • Finding tutorial assistance, if needed
 • Planning academic schedules to accommodate both premed coursework and other 
educational objectives, such as a study program abroad, a dual major, or a senior honors thesis
 • Locating volunteer or paid clinical and research experience
 • Strengthening your medical school application
 • Preparing for interviews and standardized tests
 • Arranging for letters of evaluation
 • Determining the most appropriate career paths based on your strengths, values, and life goals
Letters of Evaluation and Committee Letters
Another vital service that many prehealth advisors offer their students (and often their alumni) is the 
prehealth committee letter of evaluation.
This is usually a composite letter written on behalf of a medical school applicant by the college 
or university’s prehealth committee. It presents an overview of the student’s academic strengths, 
exposure to health care and medical research environments, contributions to the campus and 
community, and personal attributes such as maturity and altruism. In addition, the letter may 
address any extenuating circumstances that may have resulted in deficits in the student’s 
performance during a course or semester, provide perspective on challenges the student may 
have encountered, and explain school-specific courses and programs in which the student has 
participated.
Some undergraduate institutions do not provide composite letters of evaluation but instead 
collect individual letters throughout the student’s enrollment. Then, at the appropriate time, they 
distribute the letters to the medical schools where the student has applied. Keep in mind that letter 
of evaluation distribution, practices, and policies vary at each undergraduate institution. Under the 
Admissions section of the MSAR website, you can find more information about each school’s letter 
policy. It’s a good idea to work with your prehealth advising office to clarify how they intend to send 
letters on your behalf.
17 | Chapter 2: Undergraduate Preparation

Special Programs
Finally, depending on where you fall in the education process, the following two programs may be 
of interest.
Combined Baccalaureate-MD Programs
If you’re reading this book during the last year or two of high school, you might want to explore a 
combined baccalaureate-MD program, offered at about a quarter of U.S. medical schools. 
Graduates of these programs, which range in length from six to nine years, receive both a 
bachelor’s degree from the undergraduate institution and an MD from the medical school. For 
more details and a list of participating schools, refer to Chapter 11.
Postbaccalaureate Programs
Perhaps you’re at a different stage along the educational continuum and have already graduated 
from college. If your major was something other than science, it’s possible you may need to 
pursue additional coursework before applying to medical school. Postbaccalaureate programs 
offered at colleges and universities across the country range from formal one- or two-year master’s 
degree programs to certificate programs. They are available to help applicants who may need to 
strengthen their knowledge in the sciences, complete required premedical coursework, enhance 
their academic background, or want to change careers. You may search the Postbaccalaureate 
Premedical Programs database for these programs. You can also find medical schools with 
postbaccalaureate programs using the search features on the MSAR website.

Starting medical school is like embarking on a grand adventure, where you 
step into a whole new world brimming with excitement and possibility. It's 
true that, at first, it may feel like being dropped into a foreign society with 
its own language, tools, slang, uniforms, and culture. Being overwhelmed at 
the beginning is natural, but rest assured you’re not alone on this journey. 
Your classmates are beside you, each learning and growing as you navigate this uncharted 
territory together.
Together, you’ll experience late nights in the library, poring over the intricate anatomy of the human 
body; then, you’ll learn from caring for patients once you get onto the wards. These experiences 
will become the crucible that forges lasting bonds with your classmates. The challenges you face 
together will strengthen your relationships and open new horizons. I will forever be grateful for the 
unwavering support system I brought with me to medical school, the ones who always believed in 
me even when I doubted myself, and for the support system I made during medical school because 
they have helped me grow in ways I could never have imagined.
In the whirlwind of medical school, be sure to find moments to pause and reflect. Though the road 
ahead is long, remember that where you stand now was once beyond your wildest dreams. And the 
same will hold true in the years to come. Every day, every new experience will transform you into a 
catalyst for change. Just as Newton's Third Law applies to physical objects, it also resonates within 
medicine — recognize that you, too, can have an equal and opposite impact on those around you.  
Be a force for positive change, and you'll soon see that as medical students and budding physicians, 
we represent a more hopeful, knowledgeable, and empathetic future.
Medicine eagerly awaits your arrival. Welcome.
Undergraduate Medical Education: An Overview
At the core, all U.S. medical schools have the same purpose — to educate their students in the art 
and science of medicine, provide them with clinical experience, and prepare them to enter the next 
phase of medical training in caring for patients. That is why every school follows a similar program, 
requiring students to acquire a foundation in the medical sciences, apply this knowledge to patients’ 
diseases and treatment plans, and master clinical skills through a series of clinical rotations. (Read 
more about Canadian medical schools in Chapter 14.)
It is often said, “When you’ve seen one medical school, you’ve seen one medical school.” Each 
institution establishes its own curriculum and course requirements; so, for example, a particular 
CHAPTER 3
Your Medical School Years:  
The Education Process

class required by one institution is an elective course at another. Even when medical schools seem 
to offer identical courses, the content or execution may differ, so some of the material covered in 
immunology in one school, for instance, is presented in pathology in another. The sequence in 
which content is learned — and the method by which the content is taught — may differ as well. 
Beyond that, the ways students are graded also vary from school to school, with some institutions 
following a pass/fail system, others an honors/pass/fail system, and still others a letter or number 
grading system. And just as the culture, campus, and personality of the undergraduate schools you 
considered differed, they also differ among medical schools. The way you decide which medical 
school is the best fit for you and your needs will likely be similar to the way you chose your college.
Medical schools must meet very exacting standards to earn and maintain accreditation, as 
established by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME®). The LCME, cosponsored by 
the AAMC and the American Medical Association, accredits medical school programs that grant the 
MD degree in the United States. Accreditation by the LCME is required for schools to receive federal 
grants and participate in federal loan programs. In addition, eligibility of U.S. students to take the 
United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) — discussed on page 30 — requires LCME 
accreditation of their school. All medical schools listed in this guide are accredited by the LCME. 
LCME accreditation standards govern a wide breadth of areas of medical school programs and 
include standards related to curriculum.
Beyond accreditation requirements, the general educational content delivered by most medical 
schools is similar, although how the curriculum is structured, delivered, taught, and assessed differs 
from school to school.
A Word About Preclinical Versus Clinical Years
In the past, curriculum was typically structured in a “2+2” model, where the first two years of medical 
school were primarily classroom-based and focused on medical knowledge, typically referred to as 
the “preclinical” years and now sometimes referred to as the “preclerkship” years. The second two 
years of medical school were primarily focused on clinical experiences. In this traditional curriculum 
format, students typically concentrate their efforts on the scientific underpinnings of medicine 
during the first two years and apply and refine that knowledge during a series of clinical rotations 
during the last two years.
As curricula evolve, it is increasingly common for students to have clinical exposure earlier in their 
training, even during the first year of medical school, and more schools are integrating clinical and 
basic science learning together. In the later portions of the curriculum, sometimes referred to as the 
“clinical years,” students refine their understanding of underlying medical concepts and apply basic 
science knowledge, often delving deeper into areas and topics that are of interest and align with 
future career plans. It is important, therefore, to recognize that preclinical and clinical content can — 
and do — intersect at any stage in the medical school experience.
Building a Foundation of Knowledge
Generally, you will begin your medical school studies by learning how the human body is supposed 
to work in terms of both structure and function. The focus will then shift to abnormal conditions 
and diseases, methods of diagnosis, and treatment options. In addition, there will likely be a 
concentrated effort toward understanding clinical disciplines and making informed decisions 
about future career choices. Increasingly, some medical schools are exploring teaching normal and 
abnormal presentations together through organ system-based courses. 
22 | Chapter 3: Your Medical School Years: The Education Process

Normal Structure and Function
Along with learning about illnesses and ailments, you will learn how a healthy body works. That is 
what you will be studying right out of the starting gate, and your courses will be many — and varied.
Typically, your foundational courses will include gross and microscopic anatomy, physiology, 
biochemistry, behavioral sciences, and neurology.
Abnormalities, Diagnostics, and Treatment
In addition to what you have learned about what “healthy” looks and acts like, the focus of your 
coursework will also cover structure and function. You will study the full range of diseases and 
atypical conditions, methods by which diagnoses are made, and therapeutic principles and 
treatments. At this stage, you will cover content in immunology, pathology, and pharmacology.
Other Topics
You will be exposed to a wide variety of other topics, such as nutrition, medical ethics, genetics, 
laboratory medicine, substance use, geriatrics, health care delivery systems, research, preventive 
medicine, human sexuality, and community health, to name just a few. The subjects taught at 
medical schools are as varied, and potentially as numerous, as the institutions themselves. Topics 
may also vary depending on a school’s geographic location, mission, and patient populations.
And that’s just part of the picture. There is much more to “building a foundation” than mastering 
the scientific basis of medicine. During this period of your medical education, you will learn 
the basics of building rapport with patients, interpersonal skills, conducting physical exams, 
interpreting laboratory findings, developing clinical reasoning skills, and considering diagnostic 
treatment and alternatives — in effect, readying yourself for the clinical rotations of your medical 
school curriculum.
Finally, keep in mind that practicing medicine is not all science — or even the application of 
science (such as interpreting lab results to determine a course of treatment). Medical schools 
recognize that physicians practice in a social environment that requires effective team building, 
collaboration, and communication skills. As a result, the way students learn and are taught has 
evolved in recent years. Many medical students now also learn about health systems, such as 
health care economics, patient safety, and quality improvement, and may also engage with the 
community to understand more about public health concerns. (This is discussed in more depth on 
page 25 under “The Changing Face of Medical Education.”)
What a Typical Curriculum Includes
Many medical schools are either in the midst of, have completed, or have implemented a change 
to their curriculum; in a recent survey, 80% of responding medical schools (133 of 166) reported 
curriculum change either planned, begun, or completed, according to the Curriculum SCOPE 
Survey 2022-2023. For schools with a traditional curriculum, as described on page 22, a typical 
structure might include the following (although this is not a complete list of courses and does not 
include clerkships):
Year 1: Normal structure and function: Biochemistry, cell biology, medical genetics, gross anatomy, 
structure and function of human organs, behavioral science, and neuroscience. To prepare for 
clinical rotations, which typically begin later during medical school, clinical skills are very often, if not 
always, taught in Years 1 and 2 of a medical school’s curriculum.
Year 2: Abnormal structure and function: Abnormalities of structure and function, disease, 
microbiology, immunology, pathology, and pharmacology.
Years 3 and 4: Clinical clerkships: Generalist core topics include family medicine, internal medicine, 
obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and surgery. Residency preparation and application also 
occurs during this time.
23 | Chapter 3: Your Medical School Years: The Education Process

Other requirements: Neurology, psychiatry, anesthesiology, dermatology, urology, radiology, 
emergency medicine, and electives and/or selective courses.
Acquiring Hands-On Experience Through Rotations
A major component of your undergraduate medical education, typically during the third and 
fourth years, will be a series of clinical rotations that usually last four to six weeks each. Under direct 
supervision of faculty members, you will get firsthand experience working with patients and their 
families in inpatient and outpatient settings.
What You Will Do
During a rotation, you will be assigned to an outpatient clinic or inpatient hospital unit where you 
will assume responsibility for “working up” several patients each week — speaking with patients 
and family members, collecting relevant data and information from them, and presenting findings 
to a faculty member. Communication, interpersonal skills, interprofessional and collaborative skills, 
clinical reasoning, and clinical environment operation procedures are also taught and evaluated. 
Beyond that, you will participate in the ongoing care of patients, either during hospitalizations or 
through the course of outpatient treatment. When appropriate, you will interact not only with the 
patients but also with their families. Beyond the traditional clinical rotation opportunities, service-
learning opportunities or preceptorships that include clinical experiences are often available.
And What You Will Learn
There is no substitute for hands-on experience — and plenty of it. Mastery in any field is aided by 
deliberate, repetitive practice with supervision and helpful feedback. During your rotations, you will 
learn to apply basic science knowledge and clinical skills in diagnosing and treating patients’ illnesses 
and injuries and will become adept at interacting with patients (and their families) as you provide 
information, answer questions, and prepare your patients for likely outcomes. At the same time, you 
will become effective at working with all members of the health care team, whether at the bedside, 
during inpatient team discussions (“rounds”), or in case-based lectures and small-group discussions. 
Electives
Just like your undergraduate years, you will get to explore special interests and potential career paths 
through selectives and electives. Offered in basic behavioral clinical sciences and health systems 
as well as in basic and clinical research, electives are usually available your final year of medical 
school (although you might be able to take them other times). They may be completed on your own 
campus, at other medical schools through a visiting student program, through federal and state 
agencies, in international settings, and through service organizations. Medical students participate in 
a broad range of activities. The most popular ones are shown in Figure 3.1.

The AAMC Visiting Student Learning Opportunities ™ (VSLO®) program enables medical and public 
health students to pursue short-term learning opportunities in locations away from their  home 
institutions. Program participants include medical and public health students and institutions in 
the United States and around the globe.
The Changing Face of Medical Education
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population over age 65 is expected to be almost 74 
million by 2030 — accounting for one in every five Americans. Demographics such as that, together 
with advanced technologies, scientific discoveries, and evolving teaching techniques, all contribute 
to significant changes in medical education. You will experience firsthand the reforms taking place 
in medical education, in terms of both what you will learn and how you will learn it. Your courses may 
range from cultural competency to health care financing, and how you will benefit from educational 
developments such as computer-aided instruction, virtual patients, and human patient simulation.
What You Will Learn
You will likely wield a scalpel in anatomy class early on in medical school, just as students in 
our parents’ and grandparents’ generations did 30 and 60 years ago. That type of activity aside, 
though, there have been many significant changes in medical education content, and schools are 
continually revising their curricula to reflect advances in science, breakthroughs in medicine, and 
changes in society. For example:
 • Consider the demographic shift we will experience as the baby boomers age. Physicians will spend 
an increasing amount of time treating age-related problems such as Alzheimer’s disease, heart 
failure, pulmonary disease, and bone disorders. As a result, most medical schools now include in 
their curricula content on geriatrics, palliative care, pain management, complementary medicine, 
and other similar patient population-specific material. Medical schools are also increasingly 
focused on covering patient population-specific content that varies not only based on patient 
age, but also based on gender and sexual identity, socioeconomic background and status, military 
service, and other factors.
 • Issues such as health literacy, nutrition, drug use, and domestic and intimate partner violence 
are important components of medical education. Because many of these and other health 
problems are related to culture and socioeconomic background and status, medical schools 
25 | Chapter 3: Your Medical School Years: The Education Process

are increasingly focusing on areas such as preventive medicine, health promotion, population 
health, and health equity.
 • Medical schools are focusing more on helping their students develop effective communication 
and interpersonal skills so they can interact successfully with a diverse group of patients and 
health professions colleagues. You will be taught specifically how to assess family, lifestyle, 
and socioeconomic factors that may influence your patients’ behavior or their care, and how 
to effectively collaborate with members of the health care team. Then, of course, there are 
advances in science and medicine. As researchers make breakthroughs in genetic diagnoses 
and treatments, for instance, new knowledge is incorporated into the medical school program. 
There are also expanded courses on medical ethics, examining some of the dilemmas physicians 
may face amid the advent of new technology; classes on health care economics, which includes 
instruction on cost of care, value-based care, how to explore patient affordability for treatments, 
and the health care insurance system; and sessions on evidence-based medicine, patient safety, 
and quality, providing students with the information and tools they will need to deliver the best 
possible care. Some examples of topics now included in medical education are shown in Table 3.1.
The topics described here are only an overview of some possibilities. The specific courses you will take 
as a medical student will depend on the school.

How You Will Learn
Do you imagine sitting in a large lecture hall, surrounded by hundreds of your peers? While you may 
experience that aspect of medical school, that method of teaching is being replaced (to a significant 
degree) by other techniques. Here are a few of the most widespread methods:
 • The traditional lecture-based approach is increasingly giving way to student-centered, small-group 
instruction — like the case study teaching method common in both law and business schools as 
shown in this curriculum report. You may be assigned to small groups of students — overseen by a 
faculty member — in which you will focus on specific clinical problems. The aim is to instill medical 
knowledge and skills, as well as help you build the communication and collaboration skills you will 
need as you continue your medical training and as a fully licensed physician.
 • Fast-moving technological advances have certainly affected the medical school education program. 
You will likely use a computerized patient simulator to apply the basic sciences you have mastered to 
a clinical context and refine your diagnostic skills. These simulators, easily customized to replicate a 
wide range of situations, are currently part of the curriculum in most medical schools. They are often 
customized to cover many aspects of a clinical encounter and offer medical students easy access to 
a range of medical situations. Human patient simulators allow students to engage in emotional and 
sensory learning. These interactive experiences foster critical thinking and effective communication 
skills. You are also likely to have some learning experiences with simulated or standardized patients

in which you interact with a real person trained to portray a patient case. Standardized patients (SPs) 
can be especially helpful when learning history taking, physical examination, and communication 
skills, among other skills.
 • Another way medical schools use innovative technology is with computer-aided instruction 
and virtual patients. You will apply newfound knowledge and skills via interactive web-based 
or software programs that simulate complex cases. Some advantages of computer-aided 
instruction are that it:
° Enables visualizing complex processes
° Allows independent exploration
° Offers easy access
° Costs relatively little

please refer to the applicable school listing on the MSAR website.
Determining How You Want to Practice Medicine
Required courses. Clerkships. Selectives and electives. A lot is occupying your time and energy as 
you advance through medical school. At the end of your third year and the beginning of your final 
year, you will prepare to apply to residency programs. But before you can apply, seriously consider 
how you want to practice medicine and identify the training after medical school that will prepare 
you for that work.
Choosing a Specialty and Researching Residency Programs
Choosing a medical specialty is one of the most significant decisions you will make during medical 
school, and the process can be daunting. No one can prescribe which one or more specialties are a 
good fit for you. Making a good specialty decision requires you to be proactive. You will likely begin 
the process of figuring out which specialties align with your interests, talents, and passions soon 
after you enter medical school.
The first step in choosing a specialty has little to do with the medicine at all. First, you need to 
reflect on who you are and what is important to you in your personal and professional life. Then, 
you will explore the myriad of different ways you can practice medicine. Next, you will reflect on 
who you are alongside the many options available and identify where in medicine you are likely to 
be happy and satisfied.
Upon entering medical school, you can access the AAMC Careers in Medicine® (CiM) program and 
work through the four-phase career-planning process (described above), using numerous articles, 
tools, and other resources to support you on your career exploration journey.
Once you have chosen a specialty or various specialties of interest, the CiM program can help you develop 
a smart strategy for both applying to residency and planning your medical education. Then, you can 
discover your ideal residency programs or away rotation sites with the Residency Explorer™ tool — a 
resource designed to empower you in building a tailored list of programs that align with your career 
goals and preferences. The Residency Explorer tool offers an unparalleled depth of information, providing 
insight into more than 5,000 individual residency programs across 25 specialties. It enables you to gauge 
your competitiveness relative to previous applicant pools and align your personal preferences and 
career interests with program offerings. The user-friendly interface and transparent data simplify your 
navigation of the complex residency landscape, ensuring you have the critical information needed to 
excel in your journey. 
27 | Chapter 3: Your Medical School Years: The Education Process

Applying for Residency
Applying to a residency program is like applying to medical school. You apply and submit your 
supporting documents online and go through an interview process — except this time, it is with 
a hospital program for a job opportunity. Most medical students start the process of applying 
to residency during their third or fourth year. The specialty and training path you choose will 
determine the application and matching service(s) you use to apply for residency positions. The 
Electronic Residency Application Service ® (ERAS®) is the most widely used centralized online 
application service you may use to deliver your application, along with supporting documents, to 
residency programs. The ERAS website includes many tools and resources to help you as you plan 
your application strategy and gather your supporting documents. The ERAS program also hosts 
useful webinars that include additional information and give you the chance to ask questions 
about your MyERAS® application.
Once you have submitted your application and supporting documents to your chosen residency 
programs, programs evaluate applicants’ materials, then extend interviews to applicants who 
they suspect might fit well with their program. You will interview with these programs, learning 
more about each and evaluating how they fit with your educational and career goals, while the 
programs learn more about you and assesses your fit with their structure, mission, goals, and, 
more broadly, your ability to thrive as a trainee. 
Once you complete all interviews and further consider each program, you will rank the programs 
with which you interviewed to reflect your order of preference for training in each program. 
Depending on the matching services in which you participate, programs’ preferred candidates 
and candidates’ preferred programs will be matched manually or automatically (using an 
algorithm). According to the matching service’s timeline, you will learn whether you matched 
with a residency program and, if so, which ones. There are four matching services: the National 
Resident Matching Program® Main Residency Match® (in which most residency programs 
participate), the AUA Urology Residency Match Program, the SF Match (the San Francisco Match), 
and the Joint Services Graduate Medical Education Selection Board’s program, commonly referred 
to as the “military match.” For more information on the military match, please refer to the Military 
Health System website.
You can follow Match Day celebrations on social media by using the hashtag #Match2025. Match 
Day links will be posted on the AAMC Premed Facebook page and the social platform X  
(@AAMCPreMed).
28 | Chapter 3: Your Medical School Years: The Education Process

Getting Help
In addition to using CiM on your own, the CiM program 
works in conjunction with medical schools’ career-
planning and advising services. Medical schools are 
required to provide advisors (formally or informally) to 
help students plan their academic and professional 
careers. These services are often organized and delivered 
by the student affairs office or career center and can 
include workshops, specialty interest groups and 
panels, networking receptions, and other career-related 
resources and opportunities.
Sometime in your first year, your medical school will 
likely start talking to you about exploring your career 
options and planning your medical career, explaining 
the career-planning and advising services it offers. (If you 
would like to start exploring your career sooner, contact 
your school’s student affairs or career services office.) As 
part of your school’s career services, you will likely receive 
valuable information and support in various forms, 
including emails and in person, from your student affairs 
office, your career services office, and your advisors.
Career planning will occur throughout your medical 
school experience, often within your curricular activities. 
Often, students are given dedicated time in their 
fourth year of training to fine-tune career exploration 
opportunities. As you complete your medical degree, 
faculty, staff, and advisors will be a source of trustworthy 
advice that will help guide you toward a satisfying career 
as a physician.
We will not go into detail about postgraduate work 
here since you will not need those details until later. 
But, briefly, the primary purpose of graduate medical 
education (GME) is to give medical school graduates the 
skills and knowledge they need to become competent, 
independent physicians in their desired specialty.
Residency and Fellowship Training
Residency training — the first level of GME — ranges 
in length from three to eight or more years and is 
necessary for board certification (refer to Table 3.2). 
Residency programs are conducted primarily in clinical 
settings (for example, in hospitals, outpatient clinics, 
community health centers, and physicians’ offices) and 
require residents to participate fully in patient diagnoses 
and treatment. As a resident, you will work under 
the supervision of physician faculty as you develop

experience in your chosen specialty, become proficient with common and uncommon illnesses 
and conditions, attend conferences, teach less-experienced colleagues, and generally adjust to the 
demands of practicing medicine.
Just as medical schools vary, so do residency programs. Depending on the specialty you choose, 
you might complete a preliminary year of broad clinical training before focusing on your specialty. 
In other fields, you can enter the specialty track directly. (Your medical school advisor and the CiM 
program can provide more information as you approach this stage of your medical education.)
After residency training, you can continue your graduate medical education by completing 
fellowship training. This second level of GME usually prepares physicians to subspecialize, but some 
fellowships are for training in other areas, such as research or education administration.
Graduate medical education can be a challenging and rewarding stage of your career. Many 
physicians look back on their residency and fellowship years as a time when they gained invaluable 
lessons that they carry with them throughout their careers.
Interprofessional Education
The delivery of medical care is increasingly a team-based, collaborative effort that includes doctors, 
nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, and other health care professionals. Caring for a patient 
effectively and efficiently depends on practitioners from all disciplines becoming familiar with one 
another’s roles, perspectives, languages, and communication styles.
Because medical educators across the levels of medical education want to help you develop your 
knowledge and ability, your medical education is likely to involve some form of interprofessional 
education.
You will learn to share resources, work as a unit, and participate in other activities that encourage 
interaction among various categories of health care providers.
Through these exercises, you will all become more adept and successful working as a team and be 
able to deliver higher-quality patient care.
Licensure and Certification: Ready to Practice Independently
All medical school graduates must demonstrate command of the same fundamental concepts 
before becoming licensed physicians. Physicians’ mastery of these fundamentals is ensured through 
the standards of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) for MD students and the National 
Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) for DO students. The NBME and the Federation of 
State Medical Boards (FSMB) jointly sponsor the USMLE. The NBOME sponsors the Comprehensive 
Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States (COMLEX-USA).
The USMLE exam is the final assessment of your ability to assume independent responsibility for 
delivering medical care and is administered in three steps, each at a particular stage of medical 
education:
 • Step 1: Usually taken at the end of your second year of medical school, Step 1 tests whether you 
understand and can apply basic science to the practice of medicine. Its focus is on principles 
and systems of health, disease, and methods of therapy.
 • Step 2: Many medical schools require you to take and pass the Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) 
exam before you graduate. The Step 2 CK exam assesses your ability to provide patient care 
under supervision.
30 | Chapter 3: Your Medical School Years: The Education Process

• Step 3: After you have completed your first year of residency training, you are eligible for Step 3 — 
the concluding test that determines your readiness to apply your medical knowledge and clinical 
skills without supervision, with an emphasis on patient management in outpatient settings.
Similarly, the COMLEX-USA exam is also administered in three parts:
 • Level 1: This exam is usually taken at the end of the second year of osteopathic medical school. 
It focuses on your ability to integrate understanding of biomedical science with basic clinical 
problem-solving.
 • Level 2: The Level 2 CE Clinical Science Disciplines exam focuses on clinical skills and seven 
osteopathic competency domains. It is usually taken between the third and fourth year of 
osteopathic medical school.
 • Level 3: A comprehensive exam that assesses your understanding of the core competencies 
required for safe and effective health care delivery without supervision. You will take this exam 
during your first year in residency training.
After you complete your educational and training programs and achieve passing scores on the USMLE 
or COMLEX-USA exams, you can apply for licensure in any of the 50 states, 10 Canadian provinces, three 
U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.
But . . . there is one additional step: certification. Although it is not required for medical practice, 
as licensure from a state or provincial medical board is, certification in a specialty is strongly 
encouraged. Physicians apply voluntarily for this additional credential, which is granted by the 
American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and involves a comprehensive exam. Those who have 
satisfied all ABMS requirements are certified and known as “diplomates” of the specialty board.
Continuing Medical Education: Lifelong Learning
Finally, as you likely have realized, your medical education will be a lifelong process. As medicine 
continues to advance and change, you will have opportunities to learn new skills to stay current 
with exciting and innovative developments.
The fast pace of change in medicine makes continuing education essential, so most states require 
participation in accredited continuing medical education (CME) activities. Physicians participate 
in CME programs throughout their careers, ensuring they stay up to date with the rapid 
advancements in their specialties and maintain their clinical competence. Offered by medical 
schools, teaching hospitals, and professional organizations, these CME programs are reviewed by 
the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to ensure that such programs achieve 
and uphold high standards.
CME reflects a commitment to lifelong learning that is a hallmark of the medical profession. If you 
are interested in what your CME efforts will entail, go to accme.org.

Worksheet 3.1
Thinking About Medical Specialties
First things first: You do not need to know your medical specialty now — or even need to be thinking 
about it. However, many applicants envision themselves in a specialty before beginning medical 
school based on prior experiences and medical interests.
The second thing to keep in mind: Changing your mind about what type of physician you want 
to be is not a sign that you are less committed to the profession. We know from responses to the 
AAMC Matriculating Student Questionnaire (MSQ) and Graduation Questionnaire (GQ) that most 
medical students are either undecided or change their minds about their specialty preference 
during medical school. In fact, of those who begin medical school with a specialty in mind (as 
captured by the MSQ), only about one-quarter of medical students stick with this choice throughout 
medical school (per their responses in the GQ). This means, conversely, about three-quarters of 
medical students either have no idea what specialty they'll pursue upon matriculation or end up 
changing their mind during medical school.
It is natural and expected that your choices will evolve as you gain new educational and clinical 
experiences. Keep your options open to allow for new experiences to inspire you.
That said, if you are an applicant with some exposure to specialties before medical school, you may 
find it helpful to keep a journal or notes about your experiences while they are fresh in your mind, 
which you can use once you enter medical school and begin the CiM program. You will likely find it 
helpful to refer to these notes once you have matriculated as you progress through medical school.
Here are some prompts to help you consider your specialty experiences:
• Do you have a specialty or specialties in mind? _________________________________________________
• What is your experience with that specialty? ___________________________________________________
• Have you shadowed in that specialty with different physicians or in different settings? __________
  _______________________________________________________________________________________________
• Have you shadowed in more than one specialty? If so, list them here: ___________________________
  _______________________________________________________________________________________________
• Take a moment to compare your experiences. Write down how they were similar and different 
and how you felt about each: __________________________________________________________________
You can also visit your school’s career center for more guidance about exploring medical careers. A career 
center may help you find shadowing and other opportunities that can expose you to career options. You 
could also speak with people who have already completed any experiences you’re considering.
A note about shadowing: In recent years, due to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act, or HIPAA, it may be more difficult to obtain permission to shadow a physician. Some programs 
facilitate paid experiences domestically and abroad, though they can be quite expensive. Check 
with your prehealth advising office to see if they have experience with a particular program to make 
sure it’s legitimate and safe.
For more information about shadowing, lab, and volunteer experiences, refer to:

Efeose Airewele 
Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine   
Class of 2026
As an undergraduate, my most formative experiences were global health 
opportunities in Zambia, Ghana, and Tanzania. I worked with several 
physicians and was enthralled by their ability to serve communities with 
limited resources. While I found their efforts inspiring, I was profoundly 
impacted by the devastating consequences of health inequity. After 
completing my undergraduate degree, I’d hoped to better understand how health inequities 
impacted the United States.
The COVID-19 pandemic was my unimaginable teacher. While working with infectious disease 
physicians in Boston, I learned that COVID-19 was disproportionately impacting people of color and 
those who already existed on the social fringes of society. For example, I learned that while only 40% 
of HIV patients in our clinic were Black or Latinx, 77% of our HIV patients with COVID-19 were Black 
or Latinx. The pandemic’s disparate impact highlighted that health inequities are not just an issue 
abroad but are often the result of broader social injustices that exist in the United States as well.
When it was time to select a medical school, I wanted to choose a program where diversity wasn’t 
just spoken about because it was trendy. It was important to me to find a school where nuanced 
conversations about diversity were common, feedback was well received by the administration, and 
financial investments were made toward greater authentic diversity. These priorities helped me 
choose Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
Medical schools’ efforts to recruit, educate, and support a diverse student body play a role in the 
broader effort to serve communities justly. As a Christian, my interest in diversifying medicine 
stems from a desire to better “uphold the cause of the poor and oppressed” in my communities. 
As schools train a physician workforce that more closely reflects the demographics of their 
communities, I believe we will see healthier, more equitable communities.
Defining Diversity
Diversity in higher education has become a contentious topic in public forums influencing federal and 
state-level policies. The AAMC is committed to improving health for all. The research and data show 
that we have the greatest potential to achieve health equity when the United States has a diverse and 
culturally responsive physician workforce. When people hear the word diversity, some may think only of 
race, ethnicity, or gender. But the concept of diversity is much more expansive.
Diversity refers to the richness of human differences — socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, language, 
nationality, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, geography, disability, and age. When 
considering the concept much more broadly, it may also include individual aspects such as personality, 
CHAPTER 4
Building Toward Greater Diversity
33

learning preferences, and life experiences. We also must consider the intersectionality of these various 
identities and how they may influence an individual, how people perceive them, and their experiences 
on the path to medical school. To understand how these characteristics are considered during the 
admission process at many schools, it is crucial to define holistic review practices, which are measures 
of evaluating an applicant’s experiences, attributes, and metrics in relation to institutional mission-
alignment. For further exploration of this approach, visit the Holistic Review website. Additionally, 
for guidance on interpreting the use of holistic review following the Supreme Court decision in the 
Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College case, refer to this 
informative guide. These resources provide comprehensive insights into how consideration of diversity 
is integrated into the admission process for medical education, leading to more culturally responsive 
health care providers. Let’s look at diversity through the lens of available AAMC data.
 • Consider race and ethnicity. Increasing diversity by race and ethnicity remains a critical component 
of advancing diversity in medicine, considering the underrepresentation of particular racial and 
ethnic groups. The data shows, for example, that 8.9% of applicants identified as Black or African 
American only, 6.0% identified as Hispanic or Latino only, and 0.2% identified as American Indian 
or Alaska Native (refer to 2023 FACTS Table A-10). These percentages are not sufficient to address 
physician shortages and public health needs.
 • What about family income? The data shows a need for greater socioeconomic diversity in 
medicine. Parental income of students entering medical school skews heavily to the upper 
range, with a median income of $150,000. (That’s almost double the estimated U.S. median 
family income of $74,755 in 2022, reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.) More than one in four 
students comes from a home in which the parents earn $250,000 or more a year. Students 
who have limited financial resources are less likely to have access to resources to cover test 
preparation and other expenses associated with the application process. The fees related to 
your medical school application are likely going to be the largest expense. Usually, these fees 
will fall into the following three categories: primary application fee, secondary application fee, 
and college service fee. 
 • Primary application fees — Most medical schools use the AMCAS program to process 
applications. Through this service, a student can submit a single set of application 
materials and have them sent to their chosen schools. The 2025 application fee is $175 
for the first school and $46 for each additional school. Not all schools use AMCAS, so 
it's important to check with each medical school you're interested in to determine its 
admission processes. 
 • Secondary application fees — Most medical schools require a secondary application. 
Those fees range in cost. The AAMC Fee Assistance Program provides a waiver to eligible 
students to cover all AMCAS application fees for one submission which covers up to 20 
medical schools. Check with the school regarding their policy. 
 • College service fees — There is usually a small fee for transferring a transcript from 
a college registrar, and occasionally a fee for transferring letters of recommendation. 
Check with your school’s registrar to verify whether there will be fees associated with 
these requests.
Keep in mind there may be other costs associated with the application process. Some of these 
expenses may include:
 • MCAT exam and practice materials — The initial registration fee for the MCAT exam is 
$345, which covers the cost of the exam, as well as distribution of your scores. The cost 
of applying to medical school can be a prohibitive factor for many aspiring doctors. For 
those who qualify for the Fee Assistance Program, the registration fees associated with 
34 | Chapter 4: Building Toward Greater Diversity

the MCAT exam are reduced significantly from $345 to $140. Information regarding fees 
is available on the MCAT website. MCAT exam practice material costs will vary. 
 • Interview costs — Students traveling to medical school interviews may incur 
transportation and accommodation costs, as well as what it may cost to purchase 
appropriate attire for the interview.
 • Application tools — The purchase of medical school application tools and guidebooks 
such as the Medical School Admission Requirements  subscription will incur varying 
costs. (Note: the The Official Guide to Medical School Admissions  is available for free 
from the AAMC Store.)
For more specific details on these expenses, visit the Cost of Applying to Medical School fact 
sheet. As part of our commitment to create a more diverse applicant pool, the AAMC provides 
resources such as the FIRST program (for more information about affording your education, see 
Chapter 10), the AAMC Fee Assistance Program (see Chapter 7 for more information), and free 
or low-cost preparation resources in the AAMC Store. Additionally, applicants are encouraged 
to explore scholarship opportunities through organizations like National Medical Fellowships to 
further support their educational journeys. 
 • Another perspective — gender. Women comprised the majority of students enrolled in MD-
granting institutions in 2019, and the majority of applicants, matriculants, enrollees, and graduates 
in 2021. Additionally, as Figure 4.1 displays, there are significantly fewer Black or African American 
men applicants and matriculants compared with other groups. In 2015, the AAMC published 
Altering the Course: Black Males in Medicine to better understand this trend and explore solutions. 
Since the release of the report in 2015, minimal increases in the number of Black men applying and 
matriculating to medical school have occurred. As a result, the AAMC and the National Medical 
Association partnered to form the Action Collaborative for Black Men in Medicine in August 2020 
to identify systemic solutions to address this issue.
 • Consider sexual orientation and gender identity. Data collection and reporting about 
sexual orientation and gender identity has improved. AAMC graduation data shows that of 
the 2024 Medical School Graduation Questionnaire (GQ) respondents, 1.1% self-identified as 
having a gender identity that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Of the GQ 
respondents, 86.6% self-identified as heterosexual or straight, 6.2% as bisexual, 4.2% as gay or 
lesbian, 1.5% as queer, 0.6% as asexual, and 0.7% as pansexual.
 • Increasing awareness of disability. With greater calls for inclusion, there are growing efforts to 
increase the visibility of individuals with disabilities. AAMC GQ data shows that 11.6% of medical 
school graduates indicated they have a disability. Of that group, the most-cited disabilities 
included ADHD (68.2%), psychological disability (14.4%), chronic health disability (15.4%), and 
learning disability (8.2%).
Increased diversity brings benefits that extend beyond the classroom. Research has shown that 
diversity in the physician workforce contributes to increased access to health care and to better health 
outcomes. Diversity among clinician scientists has been linked to an increase in research dedicated 
to diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic groups. (For more information, see the 
reading list at the end of this chapter.)

AAMC Programs and Resources
Considering the benefits of diversity, the AAMC is engaged in a number of programs and initiatives 
to help increase diversity to include students from a broad range of backgrounds. While these 
programs are open to all students, some are tailored to the challenges and needs of individuals 
from groups historically underrepresented in medicine. Here are some of these initiatives.
36 | Chapter 4: Building Toward Greater Diversity

Career Fairs and Enrichment Programs
Medical schools throughout the country provide various programs and resources designed to recruit 
students and prepare them for medical education. Often referred to as pathway or enrichment 
programs, some are held during the school year and others are in the summer. They are designed 
for high school students, college students, and those who already have completed undergraduate 
study. It’s a good idea to explore your local medical school’s website to see what opportunities may be 
available. The AAMC sponsors several programs:
 • Summer Enrichment and Pathway/Pipeline Programs. This site includes a free database to help 
students locate summer enrichment programs on medical school campuses. You can search 
by school, state, region, area of focus, and length of program. Go to the Medical Pathways and 
Enrichment Opportunities page to explore programs of interest.
 • Diversifying the Next Generation of Doctors: Career Fair and Workshops. This event is typically 
held each fall in conjunction with Learn Serve Lead: The AAMC Annual Meeting. Students are 
encouraged to come explore the possibilities in medicine and science. College and high school 
students, parents, prehealth advisors, school administrators, and others interested in careers 
in medicine and science can meet diversity affairs and admissions officers from U.S. medical 
schools and other health professions schools. Topics for discussion include medical school 
preparation, enrichment programs, admissions policies and procedures, financial aid, and more. 
Attendees can also participate in interactive medical and health activities and workshops. The 
AAMC also hosts other career fairs in conjunction with meetings for admissions officers, student 
affairs staff, and biomedical researchers. 
 • Summer Health Professions Education Program (SHPEP). The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s 
Summer Health Professions Education Program is a free, six-week academic enrichment program 
for college freshmen and sophomores interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, 
nursing, public health, optometry, physical therapy, and physician assistant roles. Components of 
the program include science- and quantitative-based courses, learning and study skills seminars, 
career development activities, clinical experiences, integration of wellness topics, and a financial 
planning workshop. Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and offered at 12 U.S. 
academic health centers, the program includes a stipend, housing, meals, and travel assistance. 
 • Medical School Virtual Fair. Since 2016, the AAMC has connected with more than 116,000 aspiring 
medical students and applicants through our annual Virtual Medical School Fair. This virtual 
event is free for attendees and provides the opportunity to connect virtually to admissions officers 
as well as AAMC staff with expertise in admissions, diversity affairs, financial aid, the MCAT exam, 
AMCAS application, and SHPEP, among other topics.
Aspiring Docs® — An AAMC Resource to Increase Diversity in Medicine
The AAMC Aspiring Docs® website provides resources and inspiration to help you get started on your 
path to medicine. The website includes inspiring stories from medical students and doctors, videos 
of medical students answering applicant questions, and one-page fact sheets to help you prepare 
to apply. To see what other applicants are saying about being a premed, and learn what medical 
students and residents are doing every day, follow the Aspiring Docs Diaries blog. You can email 
aspiringdocs@aamc.org if you’d like to submit a blog post!
Anatomy of an Applicant
Through the Anatomy of an Applicant resource project, the AAMC seeks to amplify the stories 
of diverse medical school applicants and demystify the core competencies to encourage and 
shape future applicants’ pathways to medical school. The Anatomy of an Applicant project 
features interview excerpts from medical students, their prehealth advisors, and the admissions 
officers who accepted them to get an insider’s perspective of their pathway to medicine and how 
they demonstrated the Premed Competencies for Entering Medical Students throughout their 
37 | Chapter 4: Building Toward Greater Diversity

application. To learn what former applicants have to say about their nontraditional medical school 
journeys, read through the Anatomy of an Applicant profiles.
Additional AAMC Resources
The AAMC also offers a wide variety of publications, online tools, and other information on the 
Advancing Diversity in Medicine website and the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website. Among 
the resources you will find are the following.
Medical Students With Disabilities: Resources to Enhance Accessibility. This guide informs 
users about current resources available to medical schools as they accept and matriculate a 
growing number of medical students with a wide range of disabilities. Specifically, this publication 
emphasizes the assistive technologies available for medical students. To learn more, go to the 
Disability and Accessibility in Academic Medicine website.
Medical Minority Applicant Registry (Med-MAR).  During the MCAT registration, students who 
are economically disadvantaged or from racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented 
in medicine can select the Medical Minority Applicant Registry (Med-MAR)  option to be included 
in the registry. This web-based program provides medical schools with basic biographical 
information and MCAT scores of registered examinees, thereby giving institutions opportunities to 
enhance their diversity efforts.
For information about the definition of “underrepresented” in medicine, visit aamc.org/urm.
Fee Assistance Program. The AAMC believes that the cost of applying to medical school should 
not be an insurmountable barrier. The AAMC’s Fee Assistance Program  is available to students 
whose financial limitations would otherwise prevent them from taking the MCAT exam or 
applying to medical school. Details about the Fee Assistance Program may also be found in 
Chapter 7 of this guide.
Data About Applicants, Matriculants, and Graduates. The AAMC collects and presents detailed data 
about medical students from different racial and ethnic groups. Most of the data is available free 
of charge on the AAMC website (and a good deal are included in this guide; refer to Table 4.2 at the 
end of this chapter). Several resources are likely to be of interest:
 • A large collection of data about medical school applicants, matriculants, and graduates is 
available on the AAMC website at aamc.org/facts.
 • The AAMC publication Diversity in Medicine, Facts and Figures 2019 (available at no charge) 
provides race and ethnicity data on medical school applicants, accepted applicants, 
matriculants, enrollment, graduates, and faculty.

Additional Programs and Resources
Just as the AAMC is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, colleges, medical schools, and 
organizations are also invested in making medical education accessible to all. Explore these other 
resources as well.
Premedical School Programs at Undergraduate Colleges. Prehealth advisors have an abundance 
of information and data at their fingertips. Not only can they help you with the application process 
and refer you to appropriate contacts, but they also know about programs that students from 
underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds have found useful.
If your college has a prehealth advisor (and most do), make sure you take advantage of this valuable 
resource. If your institution does not have a prehealth advisor, you can contact the National 
Association of Advisors for the Health Professions (NAAHP). The NAAHP website offers a list of 
NAAHP members who have volunteered to help students without access to a prehealth advisor from 
a distance.
Medical School Websites. In addition to the individual profiles on the Medical School Admission 
Requirements (MSAR) website, you’ll want to explore the medical school websites for information 
on their diversity programs and resources. A list of all U.S. and Canadian MD-granting medical 
schools is available on the MSAR website.
Medical School Diversity Affairs Representatives.  Other invaluable resources are medical school 
diversity affairs representatives. These individuals are dedicated to increasing diversity among 
medical schools at their institutions and are an excellent source of information for applicants (or 
potential applicants). You can find contact information for diversity affairs representatives for most 
U.S. medical schools in the Medical School Admission Requirements Report for Applicants and 
Advisors: Diversity and Inclusion Information. Contact information is also available within each 
medical school profile on the MSAR website.
Financial Assistance for Medical School. Don’t let the cost of medical school deter you from 
your dreams. As you’ll learn in Chapter 10, more than four-fifths of medical students across the 
country receive some form of financial assistance. Medical schools — both public and private — 
work hard to offer a variety of financial aid plans to ensure that capable students are not denied 
access to their institutions because of financial limitations. In addition to discussing possibilities 
for assistance with the financial aid officer at the medical schools that interest you, you should 
familiarize yourself with general information about financing a medical education by reading the 
relevant material in this guide and reviewing the information about loans and other programs at 
the AAMC FIRST (Financial Information, Resources, Services, and Tools) site .
Medical Student Organizations. There are national student organizations led by medical student 
leaders focused on engaging and supporting high school and college students, medical students, and 
residents. The organizations often offer a range of programs, resources, and conferences to advance 
students' career interests and provide a community of support. Some of the organizations include:
 • Association of Native American Medical Students
 • Asian Pacific American Medical Student Association
 • Latino Student Medical Association
 • Medical Student Pride Alliance
 • National First-Generation and Low-Income in Medicine Association
 • Student National Medical Association

Riya Shah
Wayne State University School of Medicine 
Class of 2025
The MCAT is a difficult exam. It wasn’t like any of the exams I’d taken during 
my undergraduate years. It was an exercise in critical thinking and knowledge 
application in a way that challenged my existing form of thought. I took the 
MCAT exam while I was in my junior year of college, so juggling my school 
responsibilities with studying for the exam was a task. However, I devised a 
game plan and started studying around six months before my exam date so I could slowly build a 
strong knowledge foundation.
For the first three months, I focused on content review. Each day I would focus on a different subject 
to ensure I covered each topic equally. This also confirmed that I progressed through each section 
when I took practice exams. During those three months, I found prep books and created a list of 
topics I wasn’t confident about. I would complete practice questions and highlight questions that I 
consistently got wrong. This list helped me to focus my studying and ensured that I could keep track 
of my weaker concepts.
The following three months were focused on taking practice exams each weekend and reviewing 
what I got wrong during the week. One of my weakest sections was CARS, so I completed one or 
two passages per day to improve my reading speed and comprehension. One piece of advice I 
highly recommend is to commit to some type of spaced repetition study method, whether that 
be flashcards, Quizlet, Anki, or whatever method works for your study style. The MCAT covers a lot 
of information, and rote memorization is not a strong strategy. Spaced repetition will continually 
and consistently test your knowledge base and ensure that old information is still recalled. The 
MCAT exam is challenging, but formulating a study plan that suits your learning style will lead you 
to success.
The Role of the MCAT Exam
Scores from the MCAT exam are used in the context of your full application to help admissions 
officers identify which students are likely to succeed in medical school.
That’s done by identifying students who have not only a basic knowledge of the natural, behavioral, 
and social sciences — the foundation necessary in the early years of medical school — but also 
strong critical analysis and reasoning skills.
It can be argued that college grades essentially do the same thing. But because an “A” at one school 
is not necessarily equivalent to an “A” at another, admissions officers don’t have a standard measure 
against which to evaluate students. The MCAT exam fills that void. As a result, virtually every medical 
school in the United States, and many in Canada, require applicants to submit recent MCAT scores.

Admissions officers look at MCAT scores in conjunction with grades and with many other selection 
factors, including those related to experiences and personal attributes, when making their decisions.
Using all these components, medical school admissions committees are able to substantially 
increase their success in predicting who will be successful in medical school.
Application programs and institutions that use MCAT scores include:
 • AMCAS
 • American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS)
 • Texas Medical and Dental Schools Application Service (TMDSAS)
 • Ontario Medical School Application Service (OMSAS)
 • Other Canadian medical schools requiring MCAT scores
 • American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicine Application Service (AACPMAS)
 • Veterinary Medical College Application Service (VMCAS)
 • Schools of Public Health Application Service (SOPHAS)
Eligibility
You’re eligible to take the MCAT exam if you plan to apply to a health professions program, including:
 • MD-granting institutions
 • DO-granting institutions
 • Podiatric (DPM) programs
 • Veterinary medicine (DVM) programs
 • Any other health-related program that will accept MCAT exam results to satisfy a test score 
admission requirement
When you register, you’ll be required to sign a statement verifying your intention to apply to a health 
professions school.
International Students
There are no additional eligibility requirements for international examinees. 
How the Exam Is Structured
The MCAT exam has four multiple-choice test sections:
 • Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems
 • Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems
 • Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior
 • Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills
The first three sections listed are organized around foundational concepts in the natural, behavioral, 
and social sciences. They reflect current research about the most effective ways for students to learn 
and use science, emphasizing deep knowledge of the most important scientific concepts.
Science education leaders say that some of the most important foundational concepts in the sciences 
ask students to integrate and analyze information from different disciplines. In that vein, questions 
in these sections ask you to combine your scientific knowledge from multiple disciplines with your 
scientific inquiry and reasoning skills. On these three sections of the exam, you’ll demonstrate four 
different scientific inquiry and reasoning skills:
47 | Chapter 5: All About the MCAT ® Exam

• Knowledge of scientific concepts and principles
 • Scientific reasoning and problem-solving
 • Reasoning about the design and execution of research
 • Data-based and statistical reasoning
The fourth section, Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills, is similar to many of the verbal reasoning 
tests you’ve taken in your academic career. It includes passages and questions that test your ability 
to comprehend and analyze what you read. This section asks you to read and think about passages 
from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences, including population 
health, ethics and philosophy, and studies of diverse cultures. The passages are followed by a series 
of questions that lead you through the process of comprehending, analyzing, and reasoning about 
the material you’ve read. This section was developed specifically to measure the analytical and 
reasoning skills you’ll need to be successful in medical school.
What the Exam Measures
The different sections of the MCAT exam are carefully designed to test the concepts and skills most 
needed by entering medical students.
The Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems and the Chemical and Physical 
Foundations of Biological Systems sections are designed to:
 • Test introductory-level biology, organic and inorganic chemistry, and physics concepts taught 
in yearlong courses
 • Test biochemistry concepts at the level taught in many colleges and universities in first-
semester biochemistry courses
 • Test cellular and molecular biology topics at the level taught in many colleges and universities 
in introductory biology sequences and first-semester biochemistry courses
 • Target basic research methods and statistics concepts described by many undergraduate 
faculty as important to success in introductory science courses
 • Determine whether you have demonstrated your scientific inquiry and reasoning, research 
methods, and statistics skills, as applied to the natural sciences
The Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section is designed to:
 • Test your knowledge and use of the concepts in psychology, sociology, and biology that provide 
a solid foundation for learning about the behavioral and sociocultural determinants of health in 
medical school
 • Target concepts taught at many colleges and universities in first-semester psychology and 
sociology courses
 • Target biology concepts that relate to mental processes and behavior, as taught at many 
colleges and universities in introductory biology
 • Target basic research methods and statistics concepts described by many undergraduate faculty 
as important to success in introductory science courses and described in many introductory 
psychology and sociology courses 
 • Determine whether you have demonstrated your scientific inquiry and reasoning, research 
methods, and statistics skills, as applied to the social and behavioral sciences
48 | Chapter 5: All About the MCAT ® Exam

The Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills section is designed to:
 • Test your comprehension, analysis, and reasoning skills by asking you to critically analyze 
information provided in reading passages
 • Include content from ethics, philosophy, studies of diverse cultures, population health, and a 
wide range of social sciences and humanities disciplines
 • Provide you with all the information you need to answer questions in the passages
MCAT Scores
You’ll receive five scores from your MCAT exam: one for each of the four sections and one 
combined, total score. The MCAT exam is not graded on a curve; it’s equated. The equating process 
compensates for small differences in difficulty between test forms and ensures that scores have the 
same meaning no matter when you take the exam or what test form you get. In your score report, 
you’ll receive the information below.
Section Scores
Each of the four sections — Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems; Chemical and 
Physical Foundations of Biological Systems; Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior; 
and Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills — is scored from a low of 118 to a high of 132, with a midpoint of 
125. You’ll receive a score for each of the four sections. (Figure 5.1 shows a sample score report.)

Your scores for the four sections are combined to create your total score. The total score ranges from 
472 to 528. The midpoint is 500.
For example, if you scored 127 on the Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems 
section; 124 on the Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems section; 127 on the 
Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section; and 123 on the Critical 
Analysis and Reasoning Skills section, your total score would be 501.
Confidence Bands
Like other standardized tests, the MCAT exam is an imperfect measure of what test-takers know 
and can do. Scores can be affected by factors like fatigue, test anxiety, and distractions during the 
test. Then again, an examinee’s score might be boosted if they were recently exposed to some of the 
topics included on the exam. The inclusion of the confidence bands is meant to remind admissions 
49 | Chapter 5: All About the MCAT ® Exam

officers not to overemphasize small differences in test scores and indicate the range in which an 
examinee’s true score likely lies. Nonoverlapping confidence bands show an examinee’s potential 
strengths and weaknesses. Overlapping confidence bands suggest there are no meaningful 
differences in performance between sections.
Percentile Ranks
The percentile ranks show how you scored relative to other MCAT examinees. You’ll receive a 
percentile rank for each individual section score and for your overall total score. Each percentile rank 
represents the percentage of examinees who received the same score as you or a lower score. The 
ranks show your scores compared with the scores of other examinees. Percentile ranks are updated 
on May 1 every year to reflect the results from the previous three calendar years. MCAT percentile 
ranks are available on the MCAT Resources page.
Score Profiles
Score profiles are included to show your strengths and weaknesses across the four sections of the 
exam. This section of the score report can help you determine how to focus your preparation if you 
decide to retake the exam. Learn more about the score scale and score report.
Valid MCAT Scores
Each medical school sets its own policy about how much time can elapse between when you take 
the exam and when you apply, as well as the latest exam date it will accept during the application 
cycle. To find out the acceptable timing for the schools you’re interested in, contact them directly 
or visit the MSAR website, which also has a table showing which schools are accepting scores from 
the previous version of the MCAT exam in their admission cycles. 
Preparing for the Exam
Preparing for the MCAT exam requires giving yourself adequate time to prepare, developing a study 
plan, and using good study strategies. Students with higher scores have reported making greater 
use of effective study strategies to prepare.
Before you develop your plan for taking the MCAT exam, ask yourself a few questions: Have I 
completed all the coursework covering the topics on the exam? Do I feel confident in all content 
areas? Are there some topics or skills I feel require more in-depth study or practice? Remember, the 
best study plans are those you can tailor to your needs.
To develop your own study schedule:
 • Get started by learning about the study and practice cycle and how to use AAMC practice exams, 
and follow our guide for Creating a Study Plan for the MCAT Exam.
 • See how other examinees prepared with this collection of testimonials: How I Prepared for the 
MCAT Exam. Check out their study schedules, strategies, and the resources they used, and note 
their best advice about how to prepare.
 • Learn more about the experience and background of MCAT examinees by exploring the Post-
MCAT Questionnaire report.
To understand what’s on the exam:
 • Review the What’s on the MCAT Exam? content outline. It contains a complete list of 
foundational concepts, content categories, skills, and disciplines you will need to know for test 
day. The outline is also available as a course in the MCAT Official Prep Hub. Read The Official 
Guide to the MCAT Exam, which is the only official comprehensive overview of the exam. It 
includes 120 practice questions and solutions. The e-book is available through Amazon.
50 | Chapter 5: All About the MCAT ® Exam

• Read The MCAT Essentials for the current testing year.
To study the content on the exam:
 • Visit the What’s on the MCAT Exam? course outline. Each topic tested on the exam is mapped 
to Khan Academy lessons and other open access, free resources. 
 • Visit Khan Academy’s MCAT Collection. This collection of over 1,100 videos and 3,000 review 
questions contains sample content from all four sections of the MCAT exam. It was created by 
the Khan Academy, with support and funding from the AAMC and the Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation. 
 • Review A Road Map to MCAT Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills in the Khan Academy 
MCAT Collection. The AAMC mapped the skills assessed in the CARS section of the MCAT 
exam to the free videos, worked examples, and practice passage sets in the Khan Academy’s 
MCAT collection. 
 To practice for the exam: 
 • The AAMC offers two free full-length practice exams and four low-cost practice exams, as well as 
low-cost question banks, written by the test developers. Learn more about our practice products.
Test Dates, Registration, and Fees
The MCAT exam dates are published on the MCAT website. Although the AAMC selects exam dates 
to ensure scores are available to meet most medical school application deadlines, we recommend 
you check the specific scheduling requirements of the schools of your choice, provided in the 
MSAR website school profiles.
To be sure you get the most complete and up-to-date information about the MCAT exam, it is 
crucial that you read the most current version of The MCAT® Essentials before you register for the 
exam. After you’ve read it, you can register online through the MCAT registration system. The most 
current information on exam fees, including costs for making changes and testing internationally 
can also be found on the MCAT website. There are no additional charges for distribution of your test 
scores to AMCAS or any other application services or institutions that use MCAT scores.
Many medical schools prefer that applicants take the MCAT exam in the spring rather than the 
summer because of the short time between the availability of late-summer scores and school 
application deadlines, so consider taking the MCAT exam 12 to 18 months before your expected 
entry into medical school.
However, it’s important to remember that you should not take the exam before you feel ready. With 
limits in place for how often you can take the MCAT exam in a given year or over a lifetime (read 
the “Retaking the Exam” section of this chapter), you should have completed basic coursework and 
should feel comfortable with your knowledge of introductory-level biology, general and organic 
chemistry, and physics — as well as first-semester psychology, sociology, and biochemistry — before 
you take the exam.
For more guidance on deciding when to take or retake the exam, please consult with your 
prehealth advisor.
51 | Chapter 5: All About the MCAT ® Exam

Fee Assistance Program
The AAMC believes the cost of applying to medical school should not be a barrier to aspiring doctors. 
Therefore, the AAMC Fee Assistance Program helps qualifying examinees with MCAT registration 
fees, test preparation products, and other relevant AAMC products and services. To use the Fee 
Assistance Program, you must be approved for the benefit before registering for the exam. The 
benefits are not retroactive; you won’t be given a refund for any resources or fees incurred before 
you qualify. Learn whether you’re eligible for the Fee Assistance Program.
Testing With Accommodations
The AAMC is committed to giving all individuals an opportunity to demonstrate their proficiency on the 
MCAT exam, which includes ensuring access to people with disabilities in accordance with relevant law.
If you have a disability or medical condition you believe requires an adjustment to the standard testing 
conditions, we encourage you to apply for accommodated testing.
For information about application timeframes and types of documentation needed, as well as how to 
apply, please refer to the MCAT Exam with Accommodations webpage.
Retaking the Exam
It can be a tough decision, but if you’re not happy with your performance on the MCAT exam, you have 
the option to take it again.
There are times when a retake is well worth considering. Perhaps you discovered that your 
coursework or study didn’t cover the topics as thoroughly as you needed. Or there’s a large 
discrepancy between your grade in a relevant subject and your score on a particular section. Or 
maybe you simply didn’t feel well the day of the exam. In all these cases, prehealth advisors may be 
of great help, and we recommend you discuss the issue with yours. However, be aware that you can’t 
choose which scores are sent to medical schools; admissions committees will see all MCAT exam 
scores you’ve earned. (On test day, you have the option to void your MCAT exam if you do not want 
your test to be scored.) Additionally, there are limits on how often and how many times you may take 
the MCAT exam: You may take the exam up to three times in a testing year, up to four times in two 
consecutive years, and up to seven times in a lifetime. Voided exams and “no shows” count toward 
your attempts in a year or over your lifetime (however, these attempts are not included in the score 
report sent to medical schools).
Score Reporting
Your scores will be available in the MCAT Score Reporting System, accessible through the AAMC 
website. No matter which option you use for sending your scores to medical schools, all attempts 
that are scored will be sent to them. You can’t withhold any of your MCAT scores from your 
applications.
You have two options for sending your MCAT scores to medical schools:
 • Send your scores to AMCAS: AMCAS is the American Medical College Application Service, 
which most U.S. medical schools take part in and which you will use to manage sending 
your application to participating institutions. Your MCAT scores are automatically released to 
AMCAS. This means you don’t need to take any additional steps to insert your scores into your 
application. You can view a list of participating schools on the AMCAS Program-Participating 
Medical Schools and Deadlines webpage. Read more about AMCAS in Chapter 7.
52 | Chapter 5: All About the MCAT ® Exam

• Send your scores to non-AMCAS schools: If you’re applying to non-AMCAS schools and programs, 
you’ll need to send your scores electronically or by mailing a copy of your official score report to 
the non-AMCAS schools. Instructions are detailed in the MCAT Score Reporting System.
Gap Year and Career Changers: Taking the MCAT Exam
If you plan to take a gap year(s) or are changing careers, be thoughtful about preparing for the 
MCAT exam. Consider factors such as how well you know the content tested on the exam and when 
you would ideally want to begin medical school. This will help you figure out the best time to take 
the exam.
 • Know when you want to apply: Many examinees consider taking their MCAT exam in the 
calendar year before the year they plan to enter medical school. For example, if you are 
applying in 2025 for entrance to medical school in 2026, you would take the exam in 2025. If 
you plan to take a gap year(s), think about whether you want to take the exam before, during, 
or after that time, and build in time to prepare.
 • Mastering the content: You are the best judge of how prepared you are. First, determine whether 
you need to take coursework or need more time to study. Some applicants need to take additional 
coursework, retake coursework that is several years old, or complete postbaccalaureate programs 
to meet application requirements. Consider this when choosing an exam date because the 
timeline may affect whether the exam will still be accepted by various medical schools.
 • Retesting and testing limits: If you think you might need to test more than once in a calendar 
year, try to schedule an exam date early in the year. This will give you more time to receive your 
scores and prepare for a retest. Remember: You can take the exam only three times in a single 
testing year, four times over two consecutive testing years, and seven times in a lifetime.
If you’ve never taken the MCAT exam and you don’t currently have a prehealth advisor to help you 
prepare, the National Association of Advisors for the Health Professions has volunteer advisors 
available. Submit a request to NAAHP.org to be connected to a volunteer advisor.

Choosing which medical schools to apply to can feel overwhelming, given the 
multitude of factors an applicant has to consider. However, the key guiding 
principle should be to focus on what matters most to you. It is essential to 
identify your non-negotiables and build the list of schools you will consider 
from there.
When conducting your research, consider several aspects, such as cost, mission alignment,  
location, proximity to family, structure of preclinical curriculum, and research opportunities, to 
name a few examples. In my experience, I found the Medical School Admission Requirements™  
(MSAR®) website and the AAMC FACTS data, particularly Table A-1, to be invaluable resources. 
Together they helped me identify schools where I believed I would be competitive and whose 
mission aligned with my values.
Remember to consult with your prehealth advisor, mentors, current medical students, and alumni 
who may be able to provide insight into the culture, workload, and overall experience of different 
medical schools. Additionally, attending medical career fairs, open houses, or virtual events can offer 
opportunities to interact with representatives and gain deeper insights into each institution.
Take the time to carefully evaluate each school based on your priorities and goals and keep an open 
mind as you explore various options. Ultimately, your medical school will nurture your personal  
and professional growth and establish a solid foundation for a successful career in medicine.
The Overall Mission of the School
Many of the differences among medical schools are obvious. Some schools are located on the East 
Coast, some on the West Coast. Some are private; others are public. Some have a large entering 
class; others are small. Some have a single main campus, while others have multiple regional 
campuses. And, as explained in Chapter 3, medical schools vary in the content of their courses, the 
way they teach, and even the way they grade and evaluate students.
These are all factors you’ll want to consider as you narrow your selection, and we touch on them in the 
following pages. But the differences go even deeper, and at their core, medical schools have diverse 
missions and priorities. Because of these distinctions, what is significant to one school may be of only 
moderate importance to another, and these qualities naturally carry into the selection process.
Deciding where to apply requires you to learn not only about the differences among schools but also to 
analyze yourself — your skills, experiences, career goals, and so forth — to identify the most appropriate 
matches. Take, for instance, an institution that places a strong emphasis on primary care. Is that the 
CHAPTER 6
Choosing Your Schools
55

career path you intend to follow? If so, and especially if you can demonstrate your interest through 
extensive experience related to that area, you become a more attractive candidate on that basis alone.
Some schools may be actively seeking students from specific geographic or rural areas. Others may 
be looking for students with a high potential for a research career. And others may want to increase 
the number of doctors who plan to practice in their state (often a goal of public institutions). The 
differing missions among schools are reflected in their admission policies and standards.
If you need help with this self-analysis, think back to the various experiences you’ve had over the 
years. The ones you found especially rewarding or inspirational are likely to correlate with a specific 
area of interest and, by extension, a career goal.
Did you volunteer for two summers at a clinic in a rural, underserved area? Perhaps that’s the 
direction you’d like to take your career in. If so, you’ll want to seek out medical schools that place a 
high priority on that area.
Were the part-time jobs you had while doing research particularly gratifying? If you’d like to pursue 
a research career, look for schools that have strong reputations in that area or are known for 
graduating a large percentage of medical students pursuing research careers.
Your interests and career goals are also demonstrated in other ways. Did you spend your junior year 
tutoring first- or second-year students in entry-level biology or chemistry? Perhaps you’d like to join 
a medical school faculty and educate the next generation of physicians. If so, find medical schools 
that have a relatively large percentage of graduates in teaching positions, and check whether schools 
are affiliated with teaching hospitals.
Once again, keep in mind that applying to medical school is a two-way street. While you’re looking 
for a match, so are the schools. Your experiences will provide good insights for the admissions officers 
and help them determine whether your interests and their missions are congruent. If you don’t know 
which medical career path you want to pursue yet, that’s okay. Aim to get as many rich and diverse 
experiences as possible so you will be a well-rounded applicant.
Kicking Off Your Research
There are several ways you can research schools to identify the ones that best match your own strengths, 
interests, and goals. Here are some factors to consider in your selection:
 • Research reputation and opportunities
 • Community-based experiences and opportunities
 • Geographic location
 • School’s teaching methods
 • Program of elective courses
 • Faculty mentorship
 • Placement of recent graduates in specialty residencies
 • Residency programs at hospitals affiliated with the school
The Medical School Admission Requirements™ (MSAR®) website. Start your research with the 
medical school profiles on the MSAR website. You’ll find each institution’s clear mission statement 
and a description of its selection factors.
School websites and literature. Also review information provided by schools themselves. Although 
the specific content varies by school, every school provides detailed material for prospective students.
56 | Chapter 6: Choosing Your Schools

Advisors. Your prehealth advisor or career counselor will be able to recommend specific schools likely 
to be a good fit. These advisors have a lot of insight about the application process, so don’t overlook 
this resource. Also, make sure you attend health career fairs to speak with admissions staff from 
medical schools and participate in premed or prehealth student organizations.
The Educational Program
It’s easy to get hung up on a specific region or location, or you may recognize the name of a prestigious 
school and want to go there simply because it sounds impressive. Consider all your options, though. 
As you weigh your decision, you’ll want to consider the differences among the educational programs 
themselves.
There’s likely going to be a strong relationship between a school’s mission and its curriculum. You’ll 
be able to gauge whether an institution’s objectives align with your interests by analyzing course 
requirements and elective programs. A medical school with a mission to graduate more primary care 
doctors may, for example, have a track that provides additional training in that area. A school that 
emphasizes research may require their students to write a thesis or devote an extended period of time 
to scholarly pursuits.
As you do your research, also consider what teaching methods you find most effective. Do you do well 
with self-directed or participatory learning exercises, or do you prefer a learning environment with the 
more traditional, lecture-based style? Although most medical schools use an educational model that 
combines a variety of methods, every program adapts its own design. Are you looking for classes that 
promote small-group discussions and problem-based learning exercises? Or are you more comfortable 
with a traditional teaching approach? Eventually, these are great topics to discuss with current 
students, but a good starting point for your exploration is a school’s website, as well as the AAMC 
curriculum directory.
There are many other factors you might want to think about. How will you be evaluated? At what 
point must students pass the first two steps of the USMLE before advancing in their education? What 
level of academic support is available? Is there a mentor system, for instance? What about cultural 
organizations and support services for historically marginalized and first-generation students — are 
they available? Questions such as these will undoubtedly enter into your final decision-making.
How Do GPA and MCAT Scores Factor In?
Don’t choose schools based solely on where you think your grades and MCAT® scores will be accepted. 
While there’s no question that your educational record is important and admissions officers seek 
candidates who are likely to succeed academically in their programs, it’s important to realize that 
academics alone do not predict who will become an effective physician, and admissions officers know 
that all too well.
There are many instances in which a “high-scoring” applicant is not accepted to a medical school — 
while an applicant with lower-than-average grades and scores is — which tells you that admissions 
officers are looking at other factors.
Admissions officers are taking a more holistic approach to evaluating applicants. Through this 
practice, admissions officers assess candidates more broadly, looking not only at their GPA and MCAT 
scores but also at their experiences and personal attributes.
You can read about the holistic approach to admissions in Chapter 8, “The Admission Decision.”
57 | Chapter 6: Choosing Your Schools

Attending Medical School in Your Home State
State residents enrolled in state-supported medical schools pay lower tuition than nonresidents. In 
addition, in-state residents are often given preference for admission (compared with out-of-state 
residents) for at least some of their spaces because the school receives state government support. 
With this in mind, you may want to strongly consider the public institutions in your state as you 
decide where to apply. Note that residency requirements are established by each state. Check with 
individual medical schools for policies regarding qualifying for in-state or residential status.
Nationally, 59.9% of 2023 matriculants attended schools in their home states.
International Students
Only a small number of international students — those who are not U.S. citizens or permitted to reside 
permanently in this country — attend U.S. medical schools. If you are an international applicant, know 
that private medical schools are more likely than public schools to accept international students, and 
most medical schools require completion of premedical coursework at a U.S. college or university. For 
more information, refer to the Aspiring Docs® fact sheet on applying as an international applicant.
Public or Private?
You may also be deliberating between public and private institutions. Typically, the most cost-effective 
option is a public medical school in the state where you live. If you’re from out of state, the cost 
differential between a public and a private school virtually disappears (refer to Table 10.1 in Chapter 
10). But don’t automatically assume, even if you’re interested in a state school near your home, that 
the private route will be more expensive under all circumstances. Some private institutions have 
large endowments that allow them to provide significant scholarship aid to qualifying students. 
These scholarships lower the “effective” tuition rate and permit those students to graduate with less 
educational debt than if they had attended a public medical school in their home state.
Cost is only one consideration, though. Another element to be aware of when investigating differences 
between private and public institutions is the school’s mission — and how it might relate to your own 
aspirations and interests. Although all medical schools — public or private — have different missions, 
certain public institutions may have specific goals related to their state, such as increasing the state’s 
supply of physicians. If the school is in your home state and you’d like to live and work there after 
graduation, that will be a factor from both your perspective and the school’s. Other public institutions 
were founded by state legislators with an emphasis on the needs of a particular patient population — 
such as elderly, rural, or underserved groups — which should enter into your evaluation if that objective 
corresponds to your own career intentions.
Additional Factors to Consider
“Additional” doesn’t mean less significant. Many other factors may be important to you as you search 
for a good fit, including:
Location. Perhaps you simply prefer a specific geographic region. Do you want to be close to family 
and friends? Do you prefer a warmer or cooler climate? Are you a fan of the East Coast or the South 
or the West? What about a bustling city environment versus a rural one? These factors play to your 
comfort level, and all are valid considerations. Beyond that, though, location can also relate to your 
career goals, as well as to a school’s mission. If you hope to specialize in geriatrics, for example, a 
medical school located in an area with a higher-than-average proportion of older adults may be 
your best choice.
58 | Chapter 6: Choosing Your Schools

That’s looking at it from your perspective. Consider, for a moment, the school’s perspective. In some 
cases, a school may be seeking students from particular geographic regions to bolster its diversity, 
and you’ll want to consider the impact — if any — that your own state residence might have on 
your application to medical schools in other areas. On the other hand, some schools look for local, 
in-state students who will continue to work and contribute to communities in that state. Review 
each school’s mission statement to see what they’re seeking in their applicants.
Size and demographics. The size and demographics of the medical school — both in terms of its 
student body and its faculty — may be a consideration for you as well. The school entries on the 
MSAR website contain data on the prior year’s entering class, including the number of students by 
race, sex, age, and other self-reported factors.
Costs. Medical education is expensive, and the expenses associated with particular institutions will 
no doubt factor into your decision. You won’t know what your actual costs will be (or the degree of 
assistance you will receive) until a school sends you a financial aid package in conjunction with its 
acceptance offer. Still, by looking through the school profiles on the MSAR website, you can get a 
general idea of the relative expenses of each institution and take those numbers into consideration 
as you narrow your selection.

Special Regional Opportunities
Finally, you should be aware that some states without a public medical school participate in 
special interstate and regional agreements that give their residents access to a medical education. 
Currently, there are five interstate agreements:
 • Delaware Institute of Medical Information and Research
 • Maine Medical Education Foundation Loan
1-800-228-3734
 • University of Utah School of Medicine contract with Idaho 
1-801-581-7498

Richard Wu
Boston University Aram V. Chobanian & Edward Avedisian School  
of Medicine  
Class of 2025
Congratulations on reaching this point in your journey! Applying to medical 
school is an incredibly exciting, though stressful, process. Over the course of 
the application cycle, you will be challenged to be thoughtful, introspective, 
and resilient. Despite everything that will be thrown at you, never lose sight 
of the fact that you can do this.
Each step of the application process is an opportunity to reflect on your journey, access your 
abilities, and learn about yourself. As you write your personal statement, you will be pushed 
to distill your entire life story into a few paragraphs, and you may find yourself agonizing over 
which formative events and experiences best represent your path to medicine. As you study 
for the MCAT exam, you’ll be surprised to realize how far you’ve come academically, and once 
again you’ll become a regular at libraries and cafes. When you take a deep breath and sit down 
for your first interview, you will find a renewed sense of accomplishment in all you have done 
as you impress your interviewer with passions that have kept you going all these years. Soon, 
you will hear your name read at your very own white coat ceremony, and your first step into the 
medical profession will truly begin.
As you go through this process, remember to remain authentic. Write and speak about 
the things that matter to you, rather than trying to fit your own story to a perceived mold. 
Admissions committees will be searching for students who best fit their school’s mission and 
values. My interviewers consistently shared my excitement around my hobbies, commitment to 
underserved communities, and advocacy work. Ultimately, I ended up at a school that aligned 
with my passions, and I could not be happier.
It is equally important to remember to be kind and compassionate to yourself. Know your 
limits and your support systems, and don’t be afraid to ask for help or take a break. I found that 
sacrificing time with friends in favor of editing my secondaries was ultimately not worth it, and 
my mental health improved drastically by not letting the application cycle take over my life.
Planning ahead will allow you to build in time for yourself! Learn the deadlines and requirements 
early so you can create a schedule that works for your own needs. I found using an online calendar 
and a spreadsheet to be instrumental in keeping myself on track. Don’t forget to lean on your 
mentors for advice, and make sure to support your peers going through the same process as well!
I cannot wait to call you a colleague one day, and I wish you the best of luck.
CHAPTER 7
Applying to Medical School

Responsibilities of the Medical School Applicant 
As a medical school applicant, you have certain responsibilities. These are reviewed at length at the end 
of this chapter, but some of the most critical are:
 • Meeting all deadlines
 • Completing the AMCAS application accurately
 • Knowing the admission requirements at each school
 • Promptly updating your AMCAS application with any change in contact information
 • Responding promptly to interview invitations
 • Filing for financial aid as soon as possible
 • Withdrawing from the schools you will not attend
For more details, read the AAMC’s “Application and Acceptance Protocols for Applicants and Admissions 
Officers” later in this chapter.
American Medical College Application Service®
You may have heard about the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS ®) from 
your prehealth advisor, your career counselor, or even your classmates. The AMCAS service is 
a centralized medical school application processing service offered by the AAMC and used by 
almost every medical school in the country. It serves as the primary application method for 
first-year entering classes. This service does not screen applicants; rather, it provides admissions 
officers with the information and tools they need to select the applicants who are the best fit for 
their institution.
The AMCAS service offers many benefits to applicants. The most obvious one is that it allows you 
to apply to as many medical schools as you want with a single application (although many schools 
require a secondary application, discussed later in this chapter). It also provides applicants with 
a single point of transmission for official transcripts, letters of evaluation, and other supporting 
documentation.
Even if you’re not yet ready to begin the application process, you can familiarize yourself with it 
at aamc.org/amcas. There, you’ll find an application overview, tips for completing an application, 
frequently asked questions, video tutorials, and the comprehensive 2025 AMCAS® Applicant 
Guide. Additionally, the 2025 AMCAS Application Workbook serves as a resource for prospective 
AMCAS applicants to help prepare you for the 2025 AMCAS application. It includes all the questions 
contained in the 2025 AMCAS application and, where applicable, the selection choices. (Note: A 
2025 AMCAS application should be completed if you intend to start medical school in summer or 
fall of 2025.)
If you have previously registered for the MCAT exam, the Fee Assistance Program, the PREview® 
professional readiness exam, or other AAMC programs and services, you’ve already created an 
AAMC username and password and received an AAMC ID. Use this same information to access the 
AMCAS application site. If you don’t already have an AAMC ID number, you’ll need to register online 
to create a username and password before you begin your application.
63 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

AMCAS Application Sections
The AMCAS application has nine sections. That may sound like a lot, but remember — you don’t have 
to complete it all at once. You can save your work and return to your application as many times as 
you want until you finish and are ready to submit it. Here’s an overview of what to expect:
1. Identifying Information. This section asks you to enter your name, birth information, and gender 
identity or expression.
2. Schools Attended. Here, you’ll enter high school and college information. Once you’ve completed 
this section (and the Identifying Information section), you’ll be able to create a Transcript Request 
Form to request official transcripts from your registrar.
3. Biographic Information. You’ll use this section to enter your contact information, citizenship 
status, legal residence, ethnicity, language(s) spoken, and other biographic information. Also, you’ll 
indicate your immigration status in the citizenship subsection. If the U.S. government approved 
your Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) application, select “DACA” from the designated 
drop-down list.
4. Coursework. You’ll enter grades and credits for every course you’ve enrolled in at any U.S., 
U.S. territorial, or Canadian postsecondary institution that appears on your official college 
transcript(s). You’re required to provide information for all the college-level courses you’ve 
taken, even if you took them during high school. For courses attempted through a study abroad 
program, carefully follow the instructions outlined in the 2025 AMCAS Applicant Guide. List 
study-abroad coursework under the foreign college, the foreign listing of your home institution, 
or the institution at which it was attempted. Do not enter the coursework twice. 
5. Work/Activities. Here, you’ll enter any work and extracurricular activities, awards, honors, or 
publications you’d like to bring to the attention of the medical schools. You may list up to 15 
experiences. You’ll then choose the three you consider to be the most meaningful and have 
up to 1,325 characters to explain why each experience was particularly meaningful to you.
6. Letters of Evaluation. In this section, you’ll provide information about people writing letters of 
evaluation on your behalf. You may want to review the AAMC’s letters of evaluation guidelines , 
a useful tool developed to help your letter writers. (This step is covered in more detail later in 
the chapter.)
7. Medical Schools. In this section, you’ll designate the medical schools to which you want to 
submit an application. In addition, you can designate which letters of evaluation you wish  
to send to specific schools.
8. Personal Statement. Here, you’ll compose an essay about why you want to go to medical school. 
(This is discussed more thoroughly later in this chapter.)
9. Standardized Tests. And finally . . . your MCAT and PREview scores. In this section, you’ll 
review your MCAT and PREview scores and enter any additional test information, such as 
GRE scores. Any MCAT scores from 2003 or later will automatically be released to your AMCAS 
application. All PREview scores from 2020 through the present will be automatically released 
to your AMCAS application. Please note: It’s important to include all the MCAT and/or PREview 
exams you’re scheduled to take on your AMCAS application and update this information as 
appropriate after you submit your application.
This is a simplified overview of the AMCAS application. Read the 2025 AMCAS Applicant Guide, and explore 
the various resources for a more thorough understanding of the application on the AMCAS website.
64 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

Please also note that the 2025 AMCAS application has the following new features to highlight: 
 • Additions to the race and ethnicity categories and subcategories for “Self-Identification”
 • A new section dedicated to specifying tribal affiliation
 • An updated list indicating which schools participate in the PREview exam (schools not 
participating will not receive PREview scores)
 • Mandatory sections marked with a red asterisk (not just mandatory fields)
Transcript Requests via the AMCAS program
In addition to completing your AMCAS application, you must request that official transcripts 
from all postsecondary institutions you’ve attended be sent to the AMCAS program. The AMCAS 
application provides a Transcript Request Form to facilitate this process with your registrar(s). If 
you’ve taken courses at a junior college, community college, trade school, or other professional 
school — regardless of whether you earned credit — within the United States, Canada, or U.S. 
territories, you must provide an official transcript from that institution. This requirement also applies 
to any college courses you took in high school. For most applicants, all official transcripts must be 
received no later than two weeks after the deadline for application materials. Please refer to the 2025 
AMCAS Applicant Guide, the AMCAS website, and the AMCAS Transcript Processing Tool for detailed 
information about official transcript requirements.
Limited Changes After Submission
It’s important to check your work carefully before you hit “submit” because you’re limited 
in what changes you can make after submission. You can change your contact information 
(such as addresses and emails) and add schools or letters of evaluation, but other than that, 
your application will be submitted to schools exactly as it was completed. Review the AMCAS 
Postsubmission Actions to see what changes are permitted after submitting your application.
Application Processing and Verification 
Once the AMCAS program has received your submitted application and all required official transcripts 
from each postsecondary school where you were registered, the AMCAS verification process begins. 
The AMCAS program verifies the accuracy of your academic record by comparing the information you 
entered on your application with what’s on your official transcripts. During the verification process, 
the AMCAS program converts transcript grades to AMCAS grades based on conversion information 
provided by colleges and universities and calculates an AMCAS GPA. The AMCAS GPA gives medical 
schools a standard way to compare applicants’ academic records. AMCAS GPAs may differ from 
the GPA shown on your records at the institutions you attended. Once verification is complete, the 
AMCAS program makes your application and MCAT and PREview scores available to all the medical 
schools you designated (MCAT scores from 2003 and later and PREview scores from 2020 and later are 
automatically included).
The Application and Admission Cycle
The AMCAS application usually opens to applicants in early May of each year and opens for submission 
in late May. Participating schools begin receiving transmission of verified application data from the 
AMCAS program in late June.
The deadlines for receipt of primary applications to medical schools that participate in the AMCAS 
application typically range from the Early Decision Program deadline on Aug. 1 (if this date falls on a 
weekend or holiday, the deadline shifts to the next business day) to the end of December. (Information 
on secondary applications is discussed later in this chapter.) However, there’s no single application 
timetable because each school establishes its own deadlines for receipt of required materials. You can 
65 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

find specific dates on medical school websites and in the school profiles on the MSAR website or on 
the AMCAS website.
Medical schools vary in the timing of their admission decisions. Most schools use rolling admissions, 
selecting students for interviews and making admission decisions as applications are received, rather 
than waiting until after a specific date to begin their evaluation process. All medical schools must wait 
until mid-October to start offering acceptance letters. You can find out if a medical school uses rolling 
admissions by checking its website. If an applicant applies to an Early Decision Program, they should 
be notified about the status of their admission by Oct. 1.
For the 2024 AMCAS application cycle, applicants on average applied to 18 schools. Most of the 
U.S. medical schools not participating in the AMCAS application for the 2025 entering class are in 
Texas. The medical schools in Texas listed below participate in the Texas Medical and Dental School 
Application Service (TMDSAS) for those pursuing the MD degree. You can learn more about this 
application service and apply to these schools on the TMDSAS website. Applicants pursuing MD-PhD 
degrees at all schools but one (Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Paul L. Foster School of 
Medicine) can do so through the AMCAS application, however.
If you’re interested in schools that do not participate in the AMCAS application, please contact them 
directly for application instructions:
 • Baylor College of Medicine
 • CUNY School of Medicine – Sophie Davis Biomedical Education Program
 • McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston
 • Texas A&M University College of Medicine
 • Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Paul L. Foster School of Medicine
 • Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine
 • University of Houston Tilman J. Fertitta Family College of Medicine
 • University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School
 • University of Texas at Tyler School of Medicine
 • University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School 
of Medicine
 • University of Texas Medical Branch John Sealy School of Medicine
 • University of Texas Rio Grande Valley School of Medicine
 • University of Texas Southwestern Medical School
You should also contact schools directly for application information if you wish to pursue a joint degree 
program, such as a baccalaureate-MD or an MD-PhD.
As far as interviews go, many admissions committees begin meeting with candidates in late summer 
and continue through spring. However, most interviews are held during the winter months. (This part  
of the admission cycle is discussed in Chapter 8.) By March 15 of the matriculation year, medical schools 
will have issued a number of acceptance offers at least equal to the expected number of students in its 
first-year entering class and report those acceptance actions to the AMCAS program. This will continue 
until the waitlist has been exhausted or all seats in the class have been filled.
66 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

Personal Statements and Letters of Evaluation
As you’ll learn in Chapter 8, “The Admission Decision,” admissions officers want to know more 
about you than just where you went to college, the courses you’ve taken, your grades, and your 
MCAT and PREview or other Situational Judgment Test scores. They want to know you on a more 
personal level. That’s why an essay and letters of evaluation are integral components of your 
medical school application.
Your Personal Statement
Every applicant is required to submit a personal essay of up to 5,300 characters (about one page) in 
length. This is your opportunity to distinguish yourself from other applicants and provide admissions 
officers with insights about why you’re interested in medicine — and why you would be a dedicated 
and effective physician.
Many admissions committees place significant weight on the Personal Statement section, so take 
the time to craft an organized, well-written, and compelling statement. Here are some questions 
you may want to consider while writing your essay:
 • Why do you want a career in medicine?
 • What motivates you to learn more about medicine?
 • What should medical schools know about you that isn’t described in other sections of the 
application?
In addition, you may wish to include information such as:
 • What hardships, challenges, or obstacles have influenced your educational pursuits?
 • Are you able to explain significant fluctuations in your academic record not explained elsewhere 
in your application?
It’s a good idea to use specific examples in your essay. Instead of writing “Challenges in my childhood 
led me to consider medicine at an early age,” write, “The summer I turned 8, my 11-year-old sister was 
diagnosed with neuroblastoma, and I witnessed firsthand the compassion and understanding with 
which the doctor dealt with my parents. It was during those first few difficult months that I decided I 
wanted to be a physician.”
Additionally, ensure that your essay is interesting, follows a logical and orderly flow, and relates 
to your reasons for choosing medicine and why you believe you’ll be successful in medical school 
and as a physician. Beyond that, be sure to use correct grammar and avoid typographical errors 
and misspellings.
For MD-PhD Applicants
If you’re applying to MD-PhD programs, you’ll be required to write two additional essays: a 
relatively brief one focusing on your reasons for pursuing the combined degree and a lengthier 
one (about three pages) describing your research activities. You can read more about these 
additional essays in the 2025 AMCAS Applicant Guide or get further guidance from your prehealth 
advisor or career counselor.
Early Decision Programs
One of your first decisions will be whether to apply to a medical school through the Early Decision 
Program (EDP) or the regular application process. Although criteria for accepting EDP applicants vary 
among schools, programs frequently require that applicants show extraordinary credentials. A small 
percentage of applicants apply through the EDP, and only about half of medical schools offer the 
option. You can learn more about program requirements on the Early Decision Program webpage. 
67 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

Letters of Evaluation
In the Letters of Evaluation section, you’ll provide information about the people writing your letters. 
Although you can add up to 10 letter entries, medical schools do not necessarily wish to receive 10 
letters per applicant. Most schools request only two or three letters. Medical schools want letters from 
people who are in a position to judge your ability to be successful in medical school, which includes not 
only your academic capabilities and accomplishments but also your personal characteristics and skills.
You can find the minimum and maximum letters accepted by each school on the MSAR website. The 
AMCAS program accepts letters of evaluation on behalf of participating medical schools. This service 
enables medical schools to receive all letters electronically from AMCAS and allows letter writers 
to send their letters to the AMCAS application rather than to each individual school. The AMCAS 
program permits additional letters, so you have the option to designate specific letters for specific 
schools. More information and a current list of schools participating in the AMCAS Letter Service is 
available on the AMCAS website. 
Medical schools have various requirements for letters of evaluation, but they all require letters in one 
form or another. If your college has a prehealth advisor, medical schools will probably require a letter 
from this individual (or from the prehealth committee, if your school has one), as well as a letter from at 
least one faculty member. In instances where there is no prehealth advisor, many medical schools may 
ask for additional letters from faculty and often specify that at least one comes from a science professor.
Some medical schools don’t specify who should write your letters and welcome additional letters 
beyond the required ones. However, be aware of any limits on the number they will accept. In all 
cases, you should review medical schools’ websites or the MSAR website for information on specific 
letter requirements. You may want to provide your letter writers with a copy of AAMC’s letters of 
evaluation guidelines.
Secondary Applications
Your primary application is your AMCAS application, which provides admissions officers with much of 
the information they need. However, most medical schools also require a school-specific “secondary” 
application because it allows them to assess a student’s reasons for applying to that particular school. 
(Medical schools will notify you if they would like you to fill out a secondary application, although you 
can also find out by looking at their profiles on the MSAR website.) Secondary applications may call 
for additional letters of evaluation, supplemental writing samples, and updated transcripts. Go to the 
websites of the medical schools you’re interested in to learn more.
Application Fees
Medical school application fees fall into four general categories:
 • AMCAS application. For the 2025 AMCAS application cycle, the processing fee is $175 and includes 
one medical school designation. Additional school designations are $46 each. Tax, where applicable, 
will be calculated at checkout. Check the AMCAS website for the latest application fee information. 
Remember, some schools don’t use AMCAS, and you may pay different fees in those instances.
 • Secondary application. In the 2025 application cycle, fees for secondary applications ranged 
from $0 to $200.
 • College service fees. Your college registrar may charge a small fee to send your transcript to 
the AMCAS program. Occasionally, you’ll incur a fee to send your letters of evaluation to the 
AMCAS program.
68 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

• MCAT exam fees. Although technically not part of the application fee, the costs associated 
with the MCAT exam are a necessary component of the overall process. The initial registration 
fee for the MCAT exam is currently $335 and covers the cost of the exam and distribution of 
your scores. In addition, you may incur fees for late registration, changes to your registration, or 
testing at international test sites.
 •  PREview exam fees. Although technically not part of the application fee, the costs associated 
with the PREview exam are a necessary component of the overall process for applicants to some 
medical schools. The registration fee for the PREview exam covers the cost of the exam and the 
distribution of your scores. In addition, you may incur fees for changes to your registration.
Read more about the MCAT exam in Chapter 5 and get up-to-date information on the MCAT website. 
For more information on application fees, please refer to the FIRST Fact Sheets. More information 
about the PREview exam is available on the PREview website.
Criminal Background Check
The AAMC facilitates a national background check on all accepted applicants to participating 
medical schools via Certiphi Screening, Inc. This service provides required background checks to 
medical schools and prevents you from paying additional fees to each medical school to run these 
checks independently.
Be aware that participating medical schools may also require applicants to undergo a separate 
national background check process if it’s required by their own institutional regulations or 
applicable state law.
Fee Assistance Program
The AAMC believes the cost of applying to medical school should not be a financial barrier to people 
interested in becoming physicians.
The AAMC Fee Assistance Program helps MCAT and PREview examinees and AMCAS applicants 
who, without financial assistance, would otherwise be unable to take the MCAT and PREview exams 
and apply to medical schools that use the AMCAS application. Visit the Fee Assistance Program 
website for details about the program’s eligibility requirements and to access the application. You’ll 
be able to use your Fee Assistance Program award benefits for up to two calendar years. Benefits 
expire Dec. 31 the year after they are awarded, regardless of when in the year you apply for, and 
receive, the award. You may apply for fee assistance only once per calendar year. Fee Assistance 
Program benefits are never retroactive.
Applicants who are approved for fee assistance in 2024 will receive the MCAT exam, AMCAS 
application, MSAR website, and PREview exam benefits.
MCAT Benefits
 • Reduced registration fees for MCAT exam dates
 • Reduced rescheduling fees for MCAT exam dates
 • A suite of MCAT prep products and resources (you’ll receive more details about these benefits if 
you’re awarded fee assistance)
69 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

Consideration for financial assistance to obtain an updated evaluation to support an application 
for MCAT exam accommodations (for more information and instructions on how to apply, please 
visit the Accommodations Financial Benefit webpage ). Regardless of how many times you’re 
awarded fee assistance, you’ll receive MCAT prep product benefits only once.
MSAR Benefit
 • Complimentary access to the MSAR website for two years ($36 value)
AMCAS Benefit
 • Waiver for all AMCAS fees for one application submission with up to 20 medical school 
designations ($1,049 value; additional fees will be charged for each medical school 
designation beyond the initial set of 20) 
PREview Benefit
 • Reduced registration fees for PREview exam dates 
 • Reduced rescheduling fees
ERAS Benefit
 • A 60% fee discount on up to 50 ERAS applications
Special Note About Deferred Entry
In recent years, most medical schools have developed delayed-matriculation policies to allow accepted 
applicants to defer entry without giving up their spot. Deferrals are granted only after acceptance, 
and deferred applicants are required to submit an AMCAS application for each year they defer. These 
programs usually require that you submit a written request, and some schools also ask for a report 
at the end of the deferral period. Matriculation delays are usually granted for one year, although 
some schools occasionally defer for longer periods of time. Some institutions may require delayed 
matriculants to sign an agreement not to apply to other medical schools in the interim, while others 
permit applications to other schools. If you’re interested in this option, seek specific information from 
schools you applied to. You can find out more about each school’s policy by viewing their profile on 
the MSAR website.
Gap Year and Career Changers 
If you’re applying to medical school after spending more than a year out of college, you’ll need 
to get transcripts from any additional coursework or degree programs you’ve completed since 
your undergraduate graduation. Even if you applied previously to medical school, you’ll need 
to resubmit official transcripts. Also, you must resubmit letters of evaluation to your AMCAS 
application each time you apply.
For more information about gap years, please refer to Making the Most of Your Gap Year.
AAMC Application and Acceptance Protocols for Applicants and 
Admissions Officers
The AAMC recommends certain protocols, outlined on the following pages, to help ensure that all 
MD and MD-PhD applicants receive timely notification about the outcome of their application and 
protect schools and programs from having unfilled positions in their entering classes. Admissions 
officers and prehealth advisors often refer to these protocols as “traffic rules.” Prospective 
applicants, their advisors, and admissions staff at medical schools and programs should all be 
aware of these application and acceptance protocols for applicants.

These protocols were developed to ensure fairness for applicants and medical schools alike. By reading 
and acknowledging the guidelines, as well as agreeing to adhere to them, applicants and medical 
schools affirm they understand the timelines and stresses involved with making these important 
decisions. They also acknowledge that their decisions affect the choices of other applicants and schools 
in the midst of making acceptance and admission decisions. Admissions officers know that most 
applicants are anxiously awaiting notifications, but their committees are also diligently working to 
build the next class for their medical schools. These rules help ensure that everyone does their best to 
make timely, ethical, and fair decisions during this hectic time. The protocols are periodically reviewed 
by the AAMC Committee on Admission and approved by the AAMC Council of Deans. The following 
protocols were approved on May 7, 2018.
71 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

Application and Acceptance Protocols for Applicants
The AAMC recommends the following steps to help ensure that all MD and MD-PhD applicants receive timely notification 
about the outcome of their applications and to protect schools and programs from having unfilled positions in their 
entering classes. These protocols are often referred to as “Traffic Rules” by admissions officers and prehealth advisors. 
Prospective applicants, their advisors, and admissions staff at medical schools and programs should all be aware of these 
Application and Acceptance Protocols for applicants. An applicant’s actions during the admissions process should be 
conducted in the spirit of professionalism and ethics expected of a future physician.
These guidelines are not intended to supersede the policies, timelines, or discretion of individual schools or programs. 
Each applicant is expected to become familiar with the procedures and requirements of each school to which they apply. 
The AAMC understands that an individual’s circumstances (e.g., delays in receiving financial aid offer or other compelling 
personal reasons) may warrant exception from one or more of the following protocols and defers to each school’s 
judgment in such cases. Below are AAMC recommendations for applicants to an MD or MD-PhD program:
1.  Understand and comply with these Applicant Responsibilities as well as with the application, acceptance, and 
admission procedures at each school or program to which you apply.
2.  Provide accurate and truthful information in all aspects of your application, interview(s), acceptance, and admission 
processes for each school or program to which you apply.
3.  Submit all application documents (e.g., primary and secondary application forms, transcript[s], letters of 
evaluation/recommendation, fees, etc.) on or before the school or program’s published deadline date.
4.  Notify all relevant medical school application services of any change, permanent or temporary, to your contact 
information (e.g., mailing address, telephone number, and email address).
5.  If you will be unavailable for an extended period of time (e.g., during foreign travel, vacation, holidays) during the 
application/admission process:
a.  Provide instructions regarding your application, and, if applicable, delegate the authority to respond to any 
offers of acceptance to a parent or other responsible individual in your absence.
b.  Inform all schools or programs at which your application remains under consideration of this person’s name, 
contact information, and authority to act on your behalf. Include dates of your unavailability and inclusive dates 
for the designation of authority to act on your behalf.
6.  Respond promptly to a school’s or program’s invitation for an interview. If you cannot appear for a previously 
scheduled interview, notify the school or program immediately that you need to cancel.
7.  Begin promptly the steps necessary to determine your eligibility for financial aid. This may include filing need-analysis 
forms early and encouraging your parents (when required) to file the appropriate income tax forms.
8.  8. In fairness to other applicants, if you have decided before April 30 not to attend a medical school or program that 
has offered you an acceptance, promptly withdraw your application from that school(s) or program(s).
9.  Out of respect for other applicants, if you receive an offer of acceptance from more than one school or program:
a.  Withdraw your acceptance from any school or program you do not plan to attend as soon as you have made 
that decision;
b.  On or before April 15, narrow your selection(s) to no more than three schools or programs and withdraw your 
acceptance(s) from all other schools or programs; and
c.  On or before April 30, choose the school or program to which you plan to matriculate and promptly withdraw 
your acceptances from all other schools or programs.
10. If you receive additional acceptances following April 30, it is your responsibility to promptly notify any school(s) you 
have decided to not attend. Your decision should be made by the deadline established by the medical school(s).
11. To the extent you have not already done so in furtherance of paragraphs 9 and 10 above, withdraw your acceptance(s) 
from all other schools or programs as soon as you matriculate at a U.S. or Canadian school or program. For the 
purposes of these protocols, matriculation means that a student has begun a pre-matriculation program, attended 
orientation immediately preceding enrollment, or enrolled in classes at a medical school.
Approved by the Council of Deans Advisory Board, May 7, 2018
*If any date falls on a weekend/holiday the recommendation(s) will apply to the following business day.
72 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

Application and Acceptance Protocols for Admissions Officers
The AAMC application policies are established protocols for applicants and admissions officers.
The AAMC recommends the following guidelines to ensure that MD and MD-PhD applicants are afforded timely 
notification of the outcome of their applications and timely access to available first-year positions and that schools and 
programs are able to reasonably anticipate accepted applicant matriculation in order to avoid unfilled positions in their 
entering classes. For the purposes of these protocols, matriculation means that a student has begun a pre-matriculation 
program, attended orientation immediately preceding enrollment, or enrolled in classes at a medical school.
These protocols are often referred to as “Traffic Rules” by admissions officers and prehealth advisors. These 
recommendations are distributed for the information of prospective MD and MD-PhD students, their advisors, 
and personnel at the medical schools and programs to which they have applied, and they are offered in the spirit 
of undertaking the admission process with the high degree of integrity expected of the medical profession. These 
guidelines are not intended to supersede the policies, timelines, or discretion of the individual schools or programs. The 
AAMC understands that an individual’s circumstances (e.g., delays in receiving financial aid offer or other compelling 
personal reasons) may warrant exception from one or more of the following protocols, and defers to each school’s 
judgment in such cases.
The AAMC recommends that each MD or MD-PhD granting school or program:
1. Comply with established procedures to:
a. Annually publish, amend, and adhere to its application, acceptance, and admission procedures.
b. Abide by all conditions of participation agreements with application services (if using).
2.   Promptly communicate admissions decisions:
a.  By October 1, notify Early Decision applicants and the American Medical College Application Service® 
(AMCAS®) of Early Decision Program (EDP) admission actions.
b.  From October 15 to March 15, notify AMCAS within five business days of all admission actions, either written or 
verbal, that have been communicated to an applicant.
c.  From March 16 to April 30, notify AMCAS within two business days of all admissions acceptance, withdrawal,  
or deferral actions, either written or verbal, that have been communicated to an applicant. All admission actions 
are listed and defined on the AAMC website.
d. From May 1 to the first day of class, notify AMCAS of all admission actions within 24 hours.
e. Notify AMCAS of each student’s matriculation within 24 hours.
f.  An acceptance action is defined as the point at which a medical school communicates a written or verbal 
acceptance offer to an applicant.
g.  An acceptance offer to any dual-degree program that occurs after an initial acceptance should follow the 
above timelines.
3.   Notify all Regular MD program applicants of their acceptance on or after October 15* of each admission cycle, but no 
earlier. Schools and programs may notify applicants of admission decisions other than acceptance prior to October 15.
4.  By March 15 of the matriculation year, issue a number of acceptance offers at least equal to the expected number of 
students in its first-year entering class and report those acceptance actions to AMCAS.
5. On or before April 30, permit ALL applicants (except for EDP applicants):
a. A minimum of two weeks to respond to their acceptance offer.
b.  To hold acceptance offers or a waitlist position from any other schools or programs without penalty (i.e., scholarships).
6. After April 30:
a. Permit all applicants:
1.   A minimum of five business days to respond to an acceptance offer. This may be reduced to a minimum 
of two business days within 30 days of the start of orientation.
2. To submit a statement of intent, a deposit, or both.
b.  Recognize and respect the challenges of applicants with multiple acceptance offers, applicants who have 
not yet received an acceptance offer, and applicants who have not yet been informed about financial aid 
opportunities at schools to which they have been accepted.
7.  In addition to any condition included in a school’s offer letter, after April 30, each school may exercise its school-specific  
procedures to confirm an accepted applicant’s intention to matriculate or to ensure that it fills each seat in its 
entering class. If a school is unable to confirm an applicant’s intention to matriculate, the school may choose to 
rescind the acceptance.
8.  Each school’s initial deposit(s) should not exceed $100 and (except for EDP applicants) and should be refundable  
at least until April 30. If the applicant enrolls at the school, the school should credit the deposit toward tuition.
9.   Making an offer of admission to an applicant who has already matriculated at another school could result in the 
other school having an unfilled slot in its class. Each school is encouraged to take reasonable measures, including 
asking applicants under consideration whether they have already matriculated at another medical school, and 
carefully consider that information when deciding whether to make an offer to an applicant.
10.  Each school, consistent with its own privacy policies, should appropriately safeguard information related to an 
individual’s application for admission or financial aid.
11.  Each school should treat all letters of evaluation submitted in support of an application as confidential, except in 
those states with applicable laws to the contrary. The contents of a letter of evaluation should not be revealed to an 
applicant at any time.

AMCAS Choose Your Medical School Tool
What is the Choose Your Medical School tool?
The AAMC American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) created this tool to support medical 
schools’ enrollment management processes and help applicants communicate their intentions about 
which medical schools they plan to attend. Schools are able to access information about only their 
accepted and alternate-list (waitlist) applicants. Applicants should use the tool at the direction of the 
schools to which they have applied.
How does this tool work?
It is important to review and follow each individual school’s admission instructions, policies, deadlines, 
and requirements. We recommend visiting each school’s admissions website, checking the Medical 
School Admission Requirements website, and directly communicating with the schools to which you 
are applying to make sure you understand and follow their specific instructions.
Note: If any date stated below falls on a weekend or holiday, the next business day applies.
Beginning Feb. 19, applicants holding one or more acceptance offers can select “Plan to Enroll” in 
the AMCAS application at any school from which they have received an acceptance offer. Making 
this selection allows schools to view in aggregate the number of applicants who selected “Plan to 
Enroll” for their schools.
 • Until April 30, applicants can, at the time they make this selection, continue to hold other 
acceptances, remain on alternate lists, and continue to interview at other schools.
 • If applicants receive new offers, they can update their selection at any time, but they can 
select only one school at a time.
 • A school will be able to see only the aggregate number of their applicants who have selected 
that school or another school in the AMCAS tool to assist them with their enrollment 
management.
 • If an applicant selects “Plan to Enroll” at another school, AMCAS will not identify the applicant 
or the other school.
Beginning April 30, accepted applicants will have two options to select: “Plan to Enroll” or “Commit 
to Enroll.” Selecting “Commit to Enroll” indicates that the applicant has made a final selection and 
withdrawn all other applications.
 • Starting April 30, the AMCAS tool will identify the applicants making either selection. This 
applicant-specific information will be visible only to schools where the applicant has a current 
acceptance or alternate-list position.
 • If an applicant selects “Commit to Enroll” to a school, all other schools where the applicant also 
holds an acceptance or alternate-list offer will be notified but will not know the name of the 
school selected.
 • Selecting “Commit to Enroll” does not automatically withdraw applications from other medical 
schools. Applicants must communicate directly with all schools about their final decision 
according to each school’s specific policy.
74 | Chapter 7: Applying to Medical School

What reports will medical schools be able to run?
Medical schools will have access to the following reports:
 •  Feb. 19: Medical schools can run an aggregate report to find out how many applicants in their 
pool have selected “Plan to Enroll” at their school versus another school. In accordance with 
current protocols, applicants have until April 30 to start narrowing their accepted offers to one. 
Until then, the AMCAS tool cannot identify applicants to schools.
 • April 30: Medical schools can run detailed reports to identify accepted and alternate-list applicants 
who have selected “Plan to Enroll” or “Commit to Enroll” at their school versus another school.
 • Post-cycle: Medical schools can see where applicants in their pool matriculated (released in 
October  of the matriculating year).

Worksheet 7.1
Identifying Your Letter Writers
Be sure that you’re familiar with your school’s policy on letters of evaluation. It may provide a 
committee or composite letter on your behalf. If you’re responsible for selecting individuals to write 
your letters of evaluation, look for someone who knows you well and can speak to your readiness for 
medical school. These letters can be very valuable, so you should be thoughtful in selecting who you 
ask to write on your behalf.
How to choose an appropriate letter writer and keep track of your interactions with them
Maintain a journal or log that indicates where you’ve worked and volunteered and what classes you’ve 
taken. Review the AAMC Premed Competencies for entering students and think about which faculty 
and supervisors have observed you demonstrate these competencies. It’s important to keep track of 
the faculty members and supervisors you work with because those people will likely be able to write 
you a strong letter of evaluation when it comes time to apply. Keep notes about time spent working 
on particular projects so you can remember what you did. When you finish working with a particular 
person, you can ask them to write you a reference letter.

Mario Markho
The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences 
Class of 2027 
Most medical school applicants share common experiences in their 
undergraduate years and beyond. You have worked tirelessly for solid 
grades in class, woken up early on weekends to volunteer or shadow at a 
local hospital, participated diligently in research and other extracurriculars, 
and much more. While such accomplishments will be listed in the “Work 
and Activities” section of your application, their real value lies in how they 
have changed you as an applicant and how clearly you can express that to an admissions 
committee. Despite sharing similar experiences, each of us gains a personalized lesson 
contributing to our story as an applicant. 
My favorite part of the application process was taking a moment to sit down — before even 
starting my personal statement or any essays — and list all my experiences to draw connections 
between them. Eventually, I was able to connect the dots and fit everything into one cohesive 
story. It felt like solving a jigsaw puzzle, starting with pieces of my story from graduate school and 
working my way backward through college, high school, and grade school. I realized my passion 
for medicine is more than just one essay — it is a web of stories that trace back to my childhood 
and the foundations of who I am as an individual.
When self-reflection is done intentionally and honestly, the grueling process of writing a personal 
statement and ultimately preparing for interviews becomes not only easy, but rewarding! These 
moments give you the chance to demonstrate to admissions committees and interviewers that 
you are not only skilled for a career in medicine but also bring a viewpoint that is distinct from 
your medical school peers. Every school has its own idea of the ideal physician, so it’s important to 
recognize that your personal goals and background may not align perfectly with every school you 
apply to. Rejections will come, and that is normal! There is only one you, and you can only attend 
one medical school. As long as you are your sincere self on the interview trail, you will find yourself 
spending the next four years or more flourishing in the right program. 
Holistic Review of Medical School Applicants
What does “holistic review” mean, and how does it affect the admission review process?
Holistic review is a flexible, mission-driven approach to recruit and assess an individual’s 
competencies by considering their experiences, attributes, and metrics in order to select applicants 
who will best contribute to the program’s unique goals, learning environment, and the practice of 
medicine. When admissions committees select individual applicants, they intentionally try to create 
a broadly diverse class to help fulfill their school’s mission and enhance the learning environment. 
Diversity encompasses all aspects of human differences, including but not limited to:
CHAPTER 8
The Admission Decision
78

• Age
 • Disability
 • Ethnicity
 • Gender identity
 • Geography
 • Language
 • Nationality
 • Race
 • Religion
 • Sex
 • Sexual orientation
 • Socioeconomic status
HOW DO THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ON RACE-CONSCIOUS ADMISSIONS 
IMPACT WHAT I CAN SHARE ABOUT MYSELF IN THE APPLICATION ESSAYS?
When reviewing your application, medical schools seek to understand who you are as an 
individual, including your identities, communities, and experiences and how these relate 
to your motivation for pursuing a career in medicine and your career goals. Regardless of 
the Supreme Court decisions, schools continue to prioritize who they recruit, interview, and 
accept so that it aligns with their mission. Each individual medical school will always be the 
authoritative source on what they’re looking for in an applicant, but generally, admissions 
officers tend to look for candidates with particular competencies as evidenced by their 
experiences, attributes, metrics, and motivations that align with their mission as reflected 
in their personal statements. (You can view the current mission statements in their MSAR 
profiles and in the MSAR reports.) These areas can be a way for you to provide concrete 
examples of how your “why” aligns with the mission of the schools where you apply.
Although the Harvard and UNC cases both involved challenges to what colleges and 
universities may consider in making admission decisions, neither case challenged what you 
can share about yourself as an applicant during the admissions process.
Whether you are applying for the 2025 cycle or in the future, reflect on your personal 
journey and motivations for pursuing medicine to help you present a compelling case for 
why you are a strong candidate for admission.
Each medical school’s admissions office evaluates applicants based on the mission and goals of that 
institution. Admissions committees must decide which applicants will best serve the needs of their 
patients, the community, and the medical profession at large. They seek a broadly diverse student body 
because diversity of backgrounds and perspectives has consistently been shown to drive educational 
and professional excellence. Schools look for applicants with a track record that demonstrates the 
knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors that will best prepare them to navigate challenges and 
thrive as both learners and physicians. Depending on its mission, one school might look for applicants 
who demonstrate service to communities underserved by the current health care system, while 
another school might seek applicants who have shown creativity and independent productivity in 
scholarly activities.
Admissions officers carefully review a multitude of criteria — rather than focusing on just one or two 
facets — to gain an appreciation of the whole person and their context. Many applicants believe that 
admissions officers weigh high GPAs and MCAT® scores above all else. (View the MCAT and GPA Grid 
for Applicants and Acceptees to U.S. MD-Granting Medical Schools, 2021-2022 through 2023-2024 
[aggregated]). While these academic metrics are important components of an admission decision, 
they are only one part of the overall application package. An applicant’s competencies, such as their 
ability to balance multiple priorities and responsibilities, their commitment to learning and growth, 
and the resilience they’ve shown in handling various challenges are considered along with grades 
and MCAT scores. This helps explain why there are many cases in which a high-scoring applicant with 
a near-perfect GPA may not get into medical school, while other applicants with scores and grades 
below the average do. Admission decisions involve more than academic metrics.
79 | Chapter 8: The Admission Decision

Competencies
Your competencies include the way in which you apply your knowledge, skills, and abilities, 
including how you think, achieve results, interact with others, and self-manage. Medical educators 
identified the following Premed Competencies as important for students to be successful in 
medical school and in future practice:
 • Cultural Awareness
 • Cultural Humility
 • Empathy and Compassion
 • Service Orientation
 • Interpersonal Skills
 • Teamwork and Collaboration
 • Oral Communication
 • Commitment to Learning and Growth
 • Ethical Responsibility to Self and Others 
 • Reliability and Dependability
 • Resilience and Adaptability
 • Human Behavior
 • Living Systems
 • Critical Thinking
 • Quantitative Reasoning
 • Scientific Inquiry
 • Written Communication
Schools assess your competencies by considering your experiences, attributes, and metrics. Learn 
more about the Premed Competencies.
80 | Chapter 8: The Admission Decision

Premed Competencies and Anatomy of an Applicant
While each medical school has its own process for reviewing candidates, many medical schools 
use the Premed Competencies. These competencies provide a framework to consider when 
communicating how your work, activities, and life experiences demonstrate your readiness 
for medical school. Successful medical school applicants are able to show that they possess 
the knowledge, skills, values, and attributes in the 17 defined areas shown in Table 8.1.
TABLE 8.1. Premed Competencies Endorsed by the AAMC 
To help explain the competencies and provide real examples, the AAMC created Anatomy of an 
Applicant, a resource that shares the pathways of medical students, along with commentary 
from their prehealth advisors and the admissions officers who accepted them. This resource 
was developed in direct response to inquiries from applicants, prehealth advisors, and 
admissions officers who asked the AAMC for help in better understanding how applicants can 
convey their aptitude in the Premed Competencies. It provides guidance on how the Premed 
Competencies could be developed and demonstrated through an applicant’s experiences in 
preparation for medical school.
The work and activities you are already involved with — and your life experiences — likely 
demonstrate these competencies. For example, you can show competency in scientific inquiry 
by excelling in scientific research, or you can illustrate competency in service orientation 
by leading a service trip. As you’ll see in the Anatomy of an Applicant student profiles, one 
experience can offer evidence of proficiency across multiple competencies.
These profiles share the personal stories of medical students — their paths to medical school 
and what they identify as their strongest competencies. Anatomy of an Applicant also includes 
competency definitions, the parts of an application and what they tell schools about you, and 
self-assessment worksheets

81 | Chapter 8: The Admission Decision

Experiences
Experiences are your life circumstances and the chosen activities you have taken part in, as well as 
the context in which these experiences have taken place. Your experiences convey a lot about your 
background, interests, responsibilities, capabilities, and knowledge. As a result, medical schools are 
interested in the path you have taken to get where you are at this stage in your life. They also take a 
close look at what you’ve learned along the way. It helps them gauge not only how likely you are to 
be successful in their programs but also to what degree you’ll support their mission and contribute 
value as a physician.
Chapter 2, on undergraduate preparation, mentioned how important your extracurricular activities 
may be to an admissions committee — and not just clubs and organizations within your college 
but also outside of school. Your experiences — particularly those related to medicine or research 
— are an important component that affects your competitiveness as a candidate. For instance, 
if you are balancing a 20- to 30-hour a week job to pay for school while attending classes or have 
responsibilities caring for a younger sibling or elderly relative, those experiences are important to 
share with admissions committees. They communicate information about your life and provide 
additional context for interpreting your grades. Your experiences — and the insights you gained 
from them — also help admissions committees identify what’s unique about you and how you may 
contribute to their school and the practice of medicine.
Beyond that, the degree to which you contributed to and participated in these activities is vital. Medical 
schools value a demonstration of true commitment, so if you’ve made a significant contribution to an 
organization, been involved for numerous years, or taken on increasing levels of responsibility, make that 
clear to the admissions committee. They’re interested not only in what you’ve done but also how you 
think those experiences have influenced who you are and what you want to do. A series of short-term 
involvements (volunteering a day here, spending an afternoon there) does not really convey a deep 
interest, and this lack of motivation is apparent to admissions officials. They’re looking for substantial, 
committed participation in areas that are truly important to you. Only then are they able to gain some 
insights into your real interests and judge how well your goals and their missions align.
Again, the mission of each school will play a large part in how your experience is evaluated. For 
example, institutions whose goal is to increase the number of physicians practicing in underserved 
areas will focus attention on the summer you spent volunteering in a free clinic or doing rural or 
urban community outreach on health promotion. A medical school with a social justice mission or a 
focus on addressing health inequities might look for applicants who helped to plan health screenings 
for underserved populations or engaged in advocacy efforts on a particular topic such as housing 
insecurity. In general, medical schools especially value community and volunteer experience related to 
the health care field.
Concept of “Lived Experience”
Here’s another thing to consider: Admissions officers are likely to place significance on any obstacles 
or hardships you’ve overcome to get to this point in your education. Medical schools view these 
instances as admirable experiences indicative of some very positive traits, such as resilience and 
persistence. Applicants are encouraged to use the “Other Impactful Experiences” section in the 
AMCAS application to highlight these experiences (more information about the background and 
intended use of this question can be found in the Self-reported Disadvantaged Status Question 
Update). This section was designed to provide medical school applicants with an opportunity to 
describe aspects of their background and experiences that may not be easily presented in other 
parts of the application. It is also intended to provide admissions committees with information 
82 | Chapter 8: The Admission Decision

to better understand the context of an applicant’s journey and to assist with mission alignment 
through holistic review. As with other experiences, you can help the admissions committee better 
understand and appreciate your unique contributions by describing such experiences and how they 
have influenced you and your desire to be a physician.
Experiences likely to be important to admissions committees:
 • Serving as the primary caregiver for an ill family member
 • Helping to support your family financially
 • Overcoming obstacles or hardships
 • Being employed from a young age or while in school
 • Working, volunteering, or shadowing in a health care setting
 • Participating in research
 • Participating in and leading community-based or volunteer organizations
Attributes
Admissions committees want to know if you have what it takes to become a competent and 
compassionate doctor. This includes the ability to master the science and medicine behind 
it all, of course, but it also requires that you have some key personal attributes. Admissions 
committees look at various sources to determine whether you have those attributes. Your 
attributes are your skills, abilities, personal qualities, and relevant demographic identities. While 
personal experiences, such as volunteering for three consecutive summers at a medical clinic, 
certainly convey dedication, admissions committees will look to your personal statement, letters 
of evaluation, interviews, and metrics to gauge whether you have the necessary foundation and 
desire to build on these experiences in medical school.
Medical schools analyze this broad range of attributes and give weight to specific characteristics 
that align with their missions. Examples could include where you live, your motivation for a 
medical career, languages spoken, curiosity, and maturity. 
Metrics
Admissions committees need to evaluate your academic record to consider how well your preparation, 
knowledge, and reasoning skills signal readiness for medical school.
Academic History
Your academic history helps admissions committees evaluate how well your study skills, persistence, 
course of study, and grades signal likely success at their medical school. Committees may consider:
 • Grades earned in each course and lab
 • Grade trends in the last two years of schooling
 • Number of credit hours carried in each academic period
 • Distribution of coursework among the biological, physical, and social sciences and the humanities
 • Need for remediation of unsatisfactory academic work
 • Number of incomplete grades and course withdrawals
 • Number of years taken to complete the degree program
 • The amount of advanced coursework completed in addition to the standard prerequisites and 
requirements
83 | Chapter 8: The Admission Decision

MCAT Scores
Admissions committees can better understand your likelihood of success when they add MCAT scores 
into the mix. That’s because GPAs and MCAT scores each provide unique information about readiness 
and future success. Grading scales and standards can differ significantly from college to college, and 
MCAT scores provide a standardized measure by which to compare applicants. Another reason to look 
at both is that, sometimes, higher grades can compensate for lower MCAT scores and vice versa.
In general, the better your grades and the higher your scores, the more confidence a school will have 
in your ability to succeed in your coursework. It is important to remember there’s still a wide range of 
MCAT scores and GPAs among accepted applicants and that those are used in conjunction with other 
factors, as discussed earlier in this chapter.
AAMC PREview® Professional Readiness Score
Medical schools look for applicants to demonstrate multiple core competencies that collectively 
signal readiness for medical school, including professional competencies. The PREview exam is 
designed to assess examinees’ understanding of effective and ineffective professional behavior 
across nine Premed Competencies. A growing number of medical schools have adopted the 
PREview exam into their holistic review of applications. Their use of the exam signals important 
areas for student preparation and supports medical school admissions’ evaluation of applicants’ 
readiness for more advanced instruction in these areas. In turn, applicants who submit PREview 
scores have an opportunity to demonstrate their readiness, beyond academic metrics, to receive this 
advanced instruction. The exam also provides a standardized way for schools to evaluate applicants’ 
professional competencies; they use PREview scores alongside other important, variable information 
that provides insight into an applicants’ professionalism, such as essays, experiences, and letters of 
recommendation. The number of participating schools continues to grow. Applicants can find the 
most recent list of schools on the PREview website.
Making the Evaluation
Admissions committees gauge your competency and readiness for medical school in several ways. 
Although each medical school establishes its own criteria, medical schools balance data about 
metrics with applicants’ experiences and attributes. A 2023 admissions officers survey found that 
they highly value data and information such as academic metrics, Professional Competencies, some 
demographic characteristics, and a variety of experiences when identifying applicants for interview or 
acceptance. A 2021 admissions officers survey found that the relative importance of undergraduate 
GPAs and MCAT scores decreases as more information about an applicant is gathered. Placing 
applicants’ MCAT scores in the context of their educational opportunities, lived experiences, 
academic trajectories, and personal attributes during the admission process enables medical schools 
to meet their missions and goals and not overlook students who would make valuable contributions 
to their programs.
Several elements within the application process speak to your experiences and attributes. Your 
personal comments essay, as mentioned in Chapter 7, gives you the opportunity to tell committee 
members about your extracurricular activities, distance traveled, volunteer efforts, and medical-
related work experience. The personal attributes that accompany these activities can often be 
inferred. For example, a role as an officer in a school club may indicate leadership skills. Working in 
a medical clinic summer after summer demonstrates motivation to pursue medicine. A long history 
of volunteering with fundraisers for cancer research suggests commitment to service. Applicants 
can speak to these experiences in their statements and during interviews to further underscore 
these connections. You can find more information in the 2025 AMCAS Application Workbook, with 
84 | Chapter 8: The Admission Decision

information about the three essay prompts and certification statements within the application on 
pages 30 and 33 of the workbook.
Please keep in mind that the AMCAS application now includes additional text in the essay prompts 
and certification statements that provides clarifying language for essay submissions. It reminds 
applicants that essays must be their own work and not the work of another author or the product of 
artificial intelligence.
Your letters of evaluation, also described in Chapter 7, attest to your personal attributes. (Consider 
reviewing the AAMC’s letter writer guidelines and providing it to your writers.) While the faculty and 
administrative staff at your school have experience crafting letters of evaluation, it is often helpful for 
you to suggest a few key concepts in addition to sharing AAMC resources for letter writers.
Then there are the academic metrics. As you may know, your academic record is part of your AMCAS 
application and includes both your college transcript(s) and MCAT scores. From there, committee 
members can evaluate whether you have the grades, range of coursework, and foundation of 
knowledge they seek in their successful applicants.
Schools assess your competencies by considering your experiences, attributes, and academic metrics 
in combination. Together, they give shape to what you, as an applicant, may contribute to their 
medical school and to health care at large. It’s not only about what you did and what you know, but 
also who you are and what you bring to the learning environment and the medical profession.
The Interview Is Key
In general, interviews take place after admissions staff have reviewed applications and selected 
a subset of applicants from whom they want to collect more information. Being invited to an 
interview is an indication that a medical school is interested in understanding more about you, 
the person behind the application. After interviews, admission decisions are made. If you’ve been 
invited to an interview, you should feel confident that you’ve already impressed your reviewers with 
your strong personal statement, background, letters of evaluation, and academic history. Medical 
schools usually interview significantly more applicants than their class size, thus the interview is 
likely to be the number one determining factor at this point in the admission process.
The fact that interviews are given at all is a significant distinction of medical schools; some 
professional schools don’t require them. The medical school interview attests to the degree to 
which admissions officers seek — and medical schools want — a more thorough understanding of 
you. You can take the following steps to ensure you’re prepared for it.
Review individual medical school interview information in the MSAR reports.
The AAMC has developed the Medical School Applicant Interview Preparation Guide  
to help applicants understand what to expect during the interview process. Refer to 
the Medical School Applicant Interview Preparation Guide for detailed information on 
the role of the interview, the interview timeline, types of interviews, common interview 
topics, and more.

A Quick Look at the 2023-2024 Entering Class
 • In 2023-2024, 52,577 people applied to the 2023 entering class across all MD-granting  
medical schools.
 • By the fall of 2023, 24,014 applicants had been offered an acceptance to at least one medical 
school, and 22,980 accepted applicants had matriculated.
These accepted applicants possessed a broad range of MCAT scores, ranging from 474 to 528, 
with a median score of 512, and undergraduate GPAs ranging from 1.80 to 4.00, with a median 
of 3.84. Accepted applicants also reported a wide variety of personal characteristics and life 
experiences, including over 90% reporting community service experiences. Among accepted 
applicants, women outnumbered men for the seventh consecutive year. The number of  
accepted applicants identifying as Black or African American or as Hispanic, Latino, or of  
Spanish origin decreased from the previous year.
This chapter provides relevant data for the entire applicant pool, as well as for accepted and not 
accepted applicants, for the 2023 entering class. All data presented in this chapter is accurate as  
of Oct. 29, 2023.* In the following charts:
 • “All applicants” refers to all applicants to the 2023 entering class.
 • "Accepted applicants” refers to applicants accepted to at least one medical school.
 • “Not accepted applicants” refers to applicants not accepted to any medical school.
In the following pages, we provide data related to performance on the MCAT exam; undergraduate 
GPA, MCAT scores, and undergraduate GPA combined; and undergraduate major, gender, age, type  
of application, and race and ethnicity.

Performance on the MCAT Exam
Figure 9.1 summarizes the overall performance of the 2023-2024 applicants who submitted 
scores from the MCAT exam. The figure shows that these 2023-2024 applicants achieved total 
scores ranging from 472 to 528; the median score for applicants for 2023-2024 was 508. Accepted 
applicants had total scores ranging from 474 to 528; 39 accepted applicants had total scores of 
488 or below. The total MCAT score most commonly achieved by accepted applicants was 512.

No score on a single MCAT section and no total MCAT score guarantees admission to medical school. 
Figure 9.1 shows that a substantial number of applicants with total MCAT scores of 512 and above 
were not accepted. This finding reveals the importance of factors other than MCAT performance 
— including undergraduate academic performance and a variety of personal characteristics and 
experiences — in the medical student selection process.

All applicants had cumulative total undergraduate GPAs ranging from under 2.00 to 4.00. Accepted 
applicants’ total undergraduate GPAs ranged from just under 2.00 to 4.00, and 80 accepted 
applicants had total undergraduate GPAs of 2.75 or below.
As is the case with the MCAT data, the GPA data in Figure 9.2 shows that no undergraduate GPA 
ensures admission to medical school. Although applicants with total GPAs in the range of 3.75 to 
4.00 were more likely to be accepted to medical school, a significant number of such applicants 
were not accepted.
Again, these findings underscore the importance of other factors such as personal characteristics 
and life experiences in the medical student selection process.
MCAT Score
Table 9.1 combines MCAT scores and undergraduate GPAs for all 2021-2022 through 2023-2024 
applicants to medical school who submitted scores from the new exam. Note that these results are 
presented without regard to any of the other selection factors. If the data doesn’t reflect your particular 
circumstances, please see the acceptance rates for specific demographic groups.

The number of men applicants to the 2023-2024 entering class decreased by 1,350 from the number 
of men applicants to the previous year’s entering class. The number of women applicants to the 
2023-2024 class decreased by 1,428 from the previous year’s number.
Although the number of accepted applicants remained fairly constant from 1995-1996 through 
2002-2003, it started to increase in 2003-2004, from 17,542 that year to a high of 24,014 in 2023-2024. 
The number of accepted men applicants has fluctuated since 1995-1996, with a low of 8,810 in 2003-
2004 and a high of 11,271 in 2015-2016. The number of accepted women applicants has increased, 
with small fluctuations, from a low of 7,437 in the 1995-1996 entering class to a high of 13,298 in 2023-
2024. The gap between men and women applicants has gradually shifted. From 2005-2006 through 
2017-2018, men applicants outnumbered the number of women applicants. Beginning in 2018-2019, 
women applicants have outnumbered men applicants. In 2023-2024, 7,189 more women than men 
applied to medical school. The gaps between accepted men and accepted women applicants have 
also shifted. Since 2017-2018, accepted women applicants have outnumbered the men applicants. 
For the 2023-2024 entering class, 2,689 more women than men were accepted.
The national ratio of men to women applicants was 49.2 to 50.8 for the 2003-2004 entering class — the 
first time that the number of women applicants to medical school was greater than the number of 
men applicants. For the 2005-2006 entering class, there were once again more men applicants than 
women applicants, with a men-to-women ratio of 50.2 to 49.8. This trend continued until 2017-
2018, when women applicants outnumbered men, with a men-to-women ratio of 49.5 to 50.4. This 
continued to be the case in 2023-2024 (42.9 to 56.6).

Age
Figure 9.4 shows that the age distribution for all applicants to the 2023-2024 entering class was broad. 
The number of applicants between 21 and 28 years of age applying to matriculate totaled 47,795, 
the number of applicants under 21 was 424, and applicants over 28 totaled 4,399. Figure 9.4 shows a 
similar finding for accepted applicants to the 2023-2024 entering class; 24,014 accepted applicants 
were between 16 and 62 years of age at the time of expected matriculation.

Applicant and Accepted Applicant Experiences
Figure 9.5 summarizes the volunteer and research experiences of AMCAS applicants and accepted 
applicants to the 2023-2024 entering class. The figure shows a clear increase in the percentage of 
both applicants and accepted applicants reporting volunteer medical, community service, and 
research experience since 2003. For the 2023-2024 entering class:
 • Seventy-nine percent of accepted applicants reported community service and/or volunteer 
medical or clinical experience, an increase of about 3% since 2002.
 • Seventy-five percent of applicants reported community service and/or volunteer medical or 
clinical experience, an increase of about 2% since 2002.
 • Eighty-eight percent of accepted applicants reported research and/or lab experience, an 
increase of about 19% since 2002.
 • Eighty percent of applicants reported research and/or lab experience, an increase of about 17% 
since 2002.
 • Eighty-five percent of accepted applicants reported nonmedical or nonclinical community 
service and/or volunteer experience, an increase of about 20% since 2002.

Racial/Ethnic Self-Identity
Figure 9.6 shows self-reported race and ethnicity data for applicants to the 2020-2021 entering class 
through the 2023-2024 entering class. Applicants could select multiple races and ethnicities, so 
the sum of those shown does not equal the total number of applicants. Also, we could not include

University of Houston Tilman J. Fertitta Family College of Medicine  
Class of 2025 
“Can I afford this?” You are not alone in asking this question. 
As I bought study materials, paid for my applications, and ultimately chose what 
school to attend, I never doubted my academic ability or if being a physician was 
the “best” job for me. Quite frankly, I’ve never imagined myself doing anything else. 
But the fear of paying for my education was almost enough to stop me. 
These are all the things I wish I’d known when I applied to medical school, while in graduate school 
and working as a scribe:
 • Consider buying used textbooks or renting them.
 • Don’t buy more than three resources to study, and don’t buy them all at once.
 • Apply for scholarships. It’s work to find them, but it is worth it.
 • Submitting primary applications was the scariest thing I’d done. I didn’t know how expensive  
it would be. Be sure to budget for all application fees.
 • Apply for the AAMC Fee Assistance Program. Many schools will grant waivers for their 
secondary applications if you receive Fee Assistance Program benefits.
 • Talk to your advisor about additional scholarship opportunities.
 • Consider whether you’ll need to move for medical school. This will likely be expensive. 
Start planning for these expenses as soon as you can. Consider the cost of moving versus 
repurchasing large furniture. Don’t forget living expenses for your first month. You might  
have to live in the location before financial aid is disbursed.
 • Ask current students for lodging recommendations. Review your school’s cost of attendance 
(COA) to gauge living expenses and plan your budget accordingly. Look at your school’s room 
and board costs in the COA before choosing where to live. Know your recurring fees and 
estimate the flexible expenses.
 • Most U.S. medical students take out loans. Remember to borrow what you need to cover your 
living expenses. But keep in mind that you aren’t required to borrow the full amount you 
qualify for.  
And finally, remember you’re here because you belong here. Don’t let the fear of affording medical 
school take away the excitement of this experience.
CHAPTER 10
You Can Afford Medical School

Building a Strong Financial Plan
You’ll need to develop a strategy to cover the costs associated with your education. Don’t let the 
numbers discourage you. There’s help available, and you will be able to repay the loans you incur.
Table 10.1 shows that annual tuition, fees, and health insurance for the first year at state medical 
schools in 2023-2024 averaged about $40,493 for residents and $64,473 for nonresidents; at private 
schools, the average was $64,729 for residents and $66,176 for nonresidents.
According to recent surveys conducted by the 
AAMC, 70% of newly graduated MDs have medical 
school education debt, and 64% reported receiving 
some degree of help through scholarships, 
stipends, and grants (which you generally don’t 
have to repay). So, it can be done, and it is . . . by 
tens of thousands of medical students every single 
year. But first, you need a plan.
Before you borrow money, it’s important to 
understand — and adhere to — the basic principles 
of successful money management. Below are three 
basic recommendations that should help you build 
a strong financial foundation.
1. Live Within Your Means
If you don’t have a plan of action for your finances, all other efforts to afford medical school and 
handle your money wisely will be undermined. A spending plan is the cornerstone of a solid 
financial foundation. Let’s face it: Money will be tight during medical school, and a realistic 
spending plan will be critical to your financial well-being. A well-crafted plan will help you 
maintain better control of your spending, ensure you cover your essential expenses, and prepare 
you for unexpected expenses by building an emergency fund.
Your Total Income  –  Your Total Expenses  =  Your Discretionary Income
Creating a budget involves the following items:
 • Income — Document incoming funds, which likely will be in the form of financial aid (loans, 
scholarships, or grants). Remember, you don’t need to accept all the financial aid that is 
offered to you. Determine what is truly needed so that you do not borrow too much.
 • Expenses — Identify outgoing expenses, like tuition, fees, housing, food, and miscellaneous. 
Use your school’s COA as a guideline for determining what expenses you may have.
 • Discretionary income — Subtract your expenses from your income to determine whether your 
budget leaves you with any discretionary income. If your expenses exceed your income, then 
you will need to make adjustments to your income or expenses.
 • Once you know what items should be included in your budget, use the following resources to 
create your budget:
° The AAMC Financial Information, Resources, Services, and Tools (FIRST) program  provides 
several budgeting articles and tools that can help you, including a student budget 
worksheet.
° The AAMC Financial Wellness program provides a budgeting module, an online budgeting 
tool, and a tool that can help you track your monthly expenses.

2.  Manage Your Debt Wisely
 • It’s understandable that most medical students borrow loans to fund their education. The 
median medical education debt for the class of 2023 was $200,000. The ability to manage debt 
wisely is important, and it becomes even more critical for you — a prospective medical student 
— when you consider the degree to which you will likely rely on loans.
 • Be conscious of the amount you borrow — and be comfortable knowing that your future 
income will allow you to repay your student loan debt.
 • Educate yourself about various financing possibilities before you attend medical school, and 
diligently search for free money, such as scholarships, grants, and loan repayment assistance 
programs.
 • Understand the responsibilities — beyond making payments — that come with student loans. 
These responsibilities include knowing what loans you have incurred, where to send payments, 
and when payments are due. You’ll also be responsible for notifying your loan servicer(s) of any 
changes to your name, contact information, or enrollment status.
 • Stay organized. Maintain accurate financial aid records, copies of application forms, and any 
related paperwork. This also means opening and reading all mail pertaining to your student 
loan debt. The MedLoans Organizer and Calculator is a tool to help you keep your loans 
organized. Every accepted medical school student is given access to this free tool.
 • Many financial resources are available, including resources provided by your prehealth advisor, 
the information in this book, and the AAMC FIRST program. FIRST provides resources to help 
medical school applicants and students make smart decisions about student loans, effectively 
manage their education debt, and expand their financial skills. The AAMC also provides 
financial management assistance through a financial literacy program. This program provides 
practical information on budgeting, credit, debt management, and more. Register for your free 
Financial Wellness account.
 • The financial aid offered by each medical school may be a significant factor when you’re 
deciding which offer to accept. For information on this and other considerations, refer to 
Chapter 6, "Choosing Your Schools."
97 | Chapter 10: You Can Afford Medical School

3. Maintain Good Credit
 • As part of the financial aid application process, some financing options may require a credit 
check. If you have credit issues, contact the medical school’s financial aid office to discuss 
options and next steps for securing financing for your education. 
 • There are numerous resources to help you manage, maintain, and strengthen your credit. 
Having a good credit score can increase your ability to qualify for and obtain better interest rates 
for credit-based loans, land a job, and rent an apartment. For more information, please see this 
article, and review FIRST’s Monitoring, Maintaining, and Improving Your Credit Score webinar.
Tips to Help Your Credit Score
 • Pay your bills on time
 • Limit your credit accounts
 • Keep balances below your credit limit
 • Pay down or eliminate debt whenever possible
 • Stay current on all outstanding credit obligations
 • Check your credit report regularly at AnnualCreditReport.com
Types of Financial Aid
How Will You Pay for Medical School?
First, remember that you’re not alone. While the ultimate financial responsibility for your medical 
education rests with you and your family, there are many resources and tools to help you. The 
financial aid staff at your medical school will assist you, but you’ll also want to talk to your prehealth 
advisor and familiarize yourself with the FIRST Fact Sheets.
Loans
It’s likely that your primary financial funding for medical school will come from federal student loans, 
as shown in the Debt, Costs, and Loan Repayment Fact Card (Figure 10.2). Federal loans are generally 
the first type of loan offered and include the following:
 • Direct Unsubsidized Loans
 • Direct PLUS Loans
In addition to the federal Direct Loan program, there are low-interest, need-based, federal loan 
programs available through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These include:
 • Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS)
 • Primary Care Loans (PCL)
Not all schools award loans from HHS, and not all students will qualify for these loans. Students should 
check with the financial aid staff at the schools they are interested in attending to find out whether 
the school participates in the program and whether they meet eligibility requirements.
Private loans can also be used to finance your medical education; however, borrowers will need 
to make sure this is the best option for their situation. These loans are borrowed from a financial 
institution or organization, not the federal government. It is often recommended that borrowers 
obtain a federal loan rather than a private loan because the borrower benefits associated with federal 
student loan programs will not likely be available with a private loan. To learn more about how these 
loans differ, review the Federal vs. Private Education Loans FIRST fact sheet and talk with the financial 
aid staff at your school.
98 | Chapter 10: You Can Afford Medical School

Many times, it can be overwhelming to think about borrowing and repaying student loans; however, 
a medical career yields strong job security and excellent income potential and should give any 
medical school graduate, practicing in any specialty, the ability to repay their education debt and 
provide for a secure living and retirement.

Grants and Scholarships
When it comes to financing your medical education, the best money is free money, often referred 
to as “gift aid,” which you normally don’t have to repay. If you are offered grants and/or scholarships, 
they will likely only cover a portion of your overall educational costs. Check with your medical 
school’s financial aid staff to find out whether any grants and scholarships are available to you. Also 
be sure to check national, state, and local organizations and businesses for grant and scholarship 
opportunities.
Campus-Based Aid
Some schools have endowment funds that allow them to offer institutional funding through loans, 
grants, or scholarships. Many times, this campus-based funding can provide a great financial value 
for students in terms of better interest rates, interest subsidies, flexible repayment terms, and other 
benefits. Check with the schools you are interested in attending to find out whether they offer any 
campus-based aid programs. If you are awarded campus-based aid, ask whether the aid will be 
offered yearly or offered for only a particular year of medical school.
The Financial Aid Application Process
The financial aid process may vary slightly by institution, so you’ll want to learn about each 
school’s requirements and processes. Many times, this information can be found on the financial 
aid website for a school. Generally, to qualify for federal aid, most schools require that you’re a U.S. 
99 | Chapter 10: You Can Afford Medical School

citizen or permanent resident, making satisfactory academic progress, and in compliance with 
federal aid eligibility requirements. These requirements can be reviewed at StudentAid.gov.
Regardless of the medical school, there’s a standard process for applying for federal financial aid.
Step 1. Fill Out the FAFSA
Completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the first step toward getting 
federal aid for medical school. Completing the FAFSA online is easy and free. The schools listed 
on your FAFSA will receive your financial information and determine your eligibility for aid. The 
FAFSA does not ask graduate/professional students to enter parental information; however, some 
schools may require this information for campus-based aid. Be sure to find out whether this is a 
requirement for obtaining aid at the school you are interested in attending.
Step 2. Investigate Other Sources of Aid
Contact the medical school’s financial aid staff (or consult their website) to investigate all available 
financial aid resources.
Step 3. Receive and Reply to the Aid Offer
Once your FAFSA and other required forms are received and processed by a medical school’s 
financial aid office, you’ll receive a financial aid offer indicating the types and amounts of financial 
aid you qualify for — along with directions for accepting or declining the aid. Be sure to follow the 
instructions to receive your financial aid in a timely manner. For more information on aid offers, review 
Understanding Your Financial Aid Offer.
The financial aid office at each school is guided by various principles, regulations, and other factors 
when offering aid. The aid offer is determined by eligibility for federal aid, available institutional 
resources, family resources, and the institution’s mission. The school uses the cost of attendance and 
other factors to make a final determination of aid eligibility. For eligibility and additional details, talk 
with the financial aid officer at the medical school you plan to attend. If you’re not sure what to ask, 
review the Top 10 Questions Premeds Should Ask Medical School Financial Aid Officers.
How Medical Schools Determine Eligibility for Financial Aid
Medical schools are sensitive to the financial needs of students. Guided by federal regulations, the 
financial aid officer will determine your aid eligibility based on the following:
How Much Does It Cost?
The cost of medical education includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and living 
expenses. These components make up the school’s COA and vary by school. You can find out the 
tuition and fees and COA of each medical school on the MSAR website or by visiting the school’s 
financial aid webpages.
What Are Your Resources?
The next figure calculated is the amount you’ll be required to pay toward the cost of your education.
Even though you’re considered independent for purposes of federal loans, some institutions require 
parental financial information to determine eligibility for institutional grants, scholarships, and 
school-based loans. School officials use this information to assess the student’s ability to pay rather 
than willingness to pay, helping ensure that certain types of aid are awarded to students with the 
greatest need.
What Aid Do You Qualify For?
The financial aid office will review their COA, the information submitted on your FAFSA, and other 
factors based on their financial aid policies to determine your aid eligibility for the upcoming 
100 | Chapter 10: You Can Afford Medical School

academic year. The medical school will send you an aid offer detailing the amount and type of 
financial aid available to you.
You’ll be asked to accept or decline the offer (or a portion of it). The amount of financial aid an institution 
offers may be an important factor in choosing which school to attend. Review Chapter 6 for additional 
information and guidance on making your selection. To further help analyze your financial aid offer, all 
accepted applicants are given complimentary access to the MedLoans Organizer and Calculator. This 
tool can be used to estimate the total cost associated with borrowing funds for medical school.
Federal Loans and Repayment
The benefits of federal student loan programs include:
 • Peace of mind. Payments are not required until after medical school is over. Payments can even be 
postponed throughout residency if a borrower doesn’t want to make payments during that time. 
 • Fixed interest rates. Rates will not rise (once the loan has been disbursed), and interest rate 
reductions may be available to borrowers who elect automatic electronic monthly payments.
 • Various repayment plans. Flexible plans are available to make payments affordable — even 
during residency.
 • Education tax credits or deductions. Some borrowers may be eligible for tax benefits; consult 
Publication 970 from the IRS for more information.
As you near graduation, financial aid staff and your loan servicer(s) will supply the details you need  
to successfully manage your debt after graduation.
Forgiveness and Repayment Assistance Programs
Loan forgiveness and repayment assistance programs are available for students interested in 
reducing their education loan debt through service. These are great options if your career goals 
align with those of the repayment or forgiveness program. The programs vary in structure, 
requirements, and award amounts.
The federal government provides both service commitment and loan repayment assistance 
benefits to medical students interested in pursuing careers in primary care and to those 
committed to working in medically underserved areas.
Additionally, the federal government has a loan forgiveness program to reward borrowers who 
choose to work in public service, and borrowers can also take advantage of income-driven 
repayment plans that also offer loan forgiveness.
The U.S. Armed Forces have programs that offer support to students enrolled in civilian medical 
schools in exchange for service in the military branch that provided the funding. After residency, 
some may even choose to be employed by the Veterans Administration, which also offers loan 
repayment assistance.
Some state programs also provide loan repayment assistance or forgiveness to students and 
graduates in return for a commitment to serve in areas of need.
For additional details on service commitment and loan forgiveness, please review the Loan 
Forgiveness, Scholarship, and Service Programs Fact Sheet.

Demi Elrod
BA-MD Candidate, Six-Year Combined BA-MD Program  
University of Missouri – Kansas City School of Medicine 
Class of 2026 
From a very young age, I knew that medicine was the right path for me. 
However, I frequently worried I would never be able to afford medical school. 
As a first-generation student from a low-income family, achieving my dream 
of becoming a doctor seemed daunting, especially considering the costs 
of applying to medical school and the burden it would place on my family and me. That’s why I 
prioritized applying to direct medical programs during high school — to alleviate the associated 
costs and anxieties about being accepted into medical school. 
Direct or combined baccalaureate medical degree programs can be incredibly empowering 
and valuable for students with specific needs and goals. Depending on the program, some, like 
mine, allow students to earn both degrees in six years, while others offer guaranteed admission 
to medical school once students complete their bachelor’s degree. This flexibility accommodates 
students who are certain about pursuing medical school after graduation, but also wish 
to explore other interests such as studying abroad or pursuing arts and language studies. 
Alternatively, faster-paced programs may be more suitable for those eager to accelerate their 
medical education. 
I would highly recommend pursuing a combined program to anyone confident that medicine 
is their calling, especially to those that may come from a disadvantaged background who may 
benefit from a direct path to realizing their dreams.
.
Benefits of Baccalaureate-MD Programs 
Combined baccalaureate-MD programs (also referred to as BS-MD or BA-MD programs) are 
designed to streamline the path to becoming a doctor by integrating undergraduate education 
with medical school training. Below are some key purposes of these programs, which vary  
by institution.
 • Reduced costs overall. By condensing the years of education, students can potentially save on 
tuition-related costs. Students often skip the gap year many applicants take before applying. 
Some schools offer financial support and scholarships for students in the undergraduate portion 
of their programs.
 • Reduced stress of medical school admissions.  Some programs allow students to bypass the 
traditional medical school application and interview process, which can be highly stressful 
and competitive.
CHAPTER 11
Baccalaureate-MD Programs
104

• Seamless transition.  These programs provide a more continuous educational experience, 
integrating undergraduate courses with premedical or early medical school coursework, 
promoting a smooth progression into medical training.
 • Attracting top talent.  Combined programs often appeal to high-achieving, motivated 
students who are committed to a career in medicine early on. They offer a clear, structured 
path for students focused on becoming a physician. 
 • Early exposure to medicine. These programs help students confirm their commitment to 
the medical field early on by immersing them in medical coursework and clinical experiences 
sooner than in traditional pathways.
 • Diversity and inclusion. Some programs specifically aim to increase diversity in the physician 
workforce by recruiting students from underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds.
 • Focused guidance.  Students in these programs often receive close mentorship from both 
undergraduate faculty and medical school professors, fostering a stronger support system for 
their academic and professional development. 
 • Focused opportunities for engagement.  Some programs offer opportunities for students to 
engage in structured research projects with faculty mentors.
These programs are designed for students who are certain about pursuing medicine and offer 
various advantages, such as reducing the burden of admissions and allowing for a more focused 
educational experience.
First and foremost, make sure that this is the correct pathway for you. Combined baccalaureate-MD 
programs are designed for students who are certain they want to study medicine, and many times 
the student makes a commitment to attend the associated medical school. It is important for you to 
decide whether you want to study medicine at this particular medical school, as this decision may 
need to be made at the point of entry into the combined program.
As a potential applicant, familiarize yourself with the mission, statement of goals, and requirements of 
each combined-degree program you are interested in to ensure an appropriate match between your 
educational and professional goals and those of the program. This information can usually be found on 
the medical school’s website. For example, some programs have restrictions on the type of bachelor’s 
degree a participant can pursue, and you should ensure that your desired major is allowable in the 
program. Make sure that the program allows you the flexibility to experience life and learning as a 
college student.
These programs typically represent relationships between a medical school and one or more 
undergraduate colleges (either in the same geographic region or based on mission-aligned students 
from around the United States); thus, they can be a part of the same university system or span different 
institutions. Learning about all the schools involved in a baccalaureate-MD program can help you 
better understand the program’s mission, features, and your future classmates.
Admission is open to qualified, mature students at the high school or early college level who are 
committed to a future career in medicine. Admitted students tend to have a set of life experiences and 
academic credentials that signal their maturity, exposure to science, and commitment to medicine. 
For more information, refer to the MSAR  website, specifically the “Combined Degree” section in 
the “Overview” for baccalaureate-MD programs. State-supported schools with a goal of increasing 
physician workforce in their region generally admit few out-of-state applicants to their baccalaureate-
MD programs; private schools tend to have greater flexibility about state of residency.
105 | Chapter 11: Baccalaureate-MD Programs

While academic requirements vary among the schools sponsoring these programs, they typically 
include successful completion of prerequisite courses in biology, chemistry, physics, English, 
mathematics, and social science, as well as a minimum GPA and standardized test scores at the high 
school or early college level. Provisional admission to the MD portion of the program may occur at the 
same time as admission to the undergraduate program or after completion of a prescribed number 
of semesters with a minimum GPA in the sciences or overall coursework. In some programs, students 
are not required to take the MCAT exam; in other programs, a minimum MCAT score must be attained 
to progress through the program. Some programs will allow multiple MCAT attempts. There are many 
different requirements, so be sure you view each program’s website for full details and are comfortable 
with the requirements.
Progressing through the program from the undergraduate to the medical curricula is usually 
contingent on a student achieving specific criteria in terms of standardized test scores, GPA, meeting 
the school’s expectations for personal and professional behavior, and for some programs, completion of 
a research project.
If you’re interested in a combined baccalaureate-MD program, consult your school counselor to ensure 
you’re enrolled in a curriculum that incorporates the courses required for admission to the program 
and prepares you for the premedical phase of this pathway. The requirements may involve specific 
high school or college courses. If you’re a college freshman or sophomore interested in these programs, 
speak with your school’s prehealth advisor or with the admissions office at the medical school; 
acceptance processes vary by school. For additional information about specific programs, contact 
each program directly. Admission to these programs is extremely competitive, and other relevant 
extracurricular activities are generally required, so be sure to ask your counselor or contact the program 
about such requirements.
This chapter contains a list of combined baccalaureate-MD programs by state and by number of years 
to complete them. For further information about the programs, refer to the MSAR website. Chapter 4 
contains information about diversity initiatives in medicine, and Chapter 7 provides details about the 
holistic review of candidates who apply to medical school.
How to Find and Prepare for Baccalaureate-MD Programs
Baccalaureate-MD programs can be a great option for high school seniors considering a career 
in medicine. If you’re a high school student, talk with your school counselor about programs that 
may be good options for you. You can use the MSAR website to search for medical schools with 
baccalaureate-MD programs. Also, explore opportunities at your school or in your community to 
get engaged in health care settings and shadow health care professionals. These experiences will 
help you understand how you fit within a career in medicine and perhaps even identify the type of 
medical setting that suits your interests, aptitudes, goals, and personality.
Each year, the list of programs changes. New programs are added, while others may be paused 
or discontinued entirely. You can use the worksheet at the end of this chapter to evaluate the 
mission statements of the programs you are interested in and decide which ones may be a good 
fit for you.

Gloria Xue
MD-PhD Candidate, Medical Scientist Training Program  
Indiana University School of Medicine  
Class of 2029 
“Would I be happy being a clinician or do I need a physician-scientist career 
to feel fulfilled?” Most MD-PhD students have mulled over this question at 
some point.
As a second-year MD-only student, I had just completed a summer immersed 
in research under the guidance of a physician-scientist. I was considering applying for an internal 
transfer to the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). After much self-reflection, I realized that 
I desired rigorous, integrated training in both research and clinical practice.
Medical students have several avenues for gaining research experience, such as standalone PhD 
programs, MS degrees, and yearlong enrichment programs. However, the dual MD-PhD degree 
offers unique opportunities by providing a streamlined curriculum that integrates clinical activities 
with research, including longitudinal research experiences, and faculty mentoring.
You should carefully consider the types of MD-PhD programs offered and how to align these 
programs with your personal research interests. Program sizes vary significantly, with some 
admitting more than 20 students each year and others with fewer than five. Additionally, program 
strengths can differ based on affiliations with institutions such as those with cancer centers or 
children’s hospitals.
While much of the available information is geared at students going directly into MD-PhD 
programs, it is also possible to transfer internally from an MD-only track. If you are interested, you 
should monitor application announcements or contact the school’s MD-PhD administrative office 
to maintain an open line of communication. 
Choosing to pursue an MD-PhD is a profound decision that requires introspection and a clear 
understanding of one's career goals. By carefully evaluating the unique opportunities and 
challenges of MD-PhD programs, you can find a path that aligns with your aspirations and 
strengths. Ultimately, the journey towards becoming a physician-scientist promises a fulfilling 
career that seamlessly integrates clinical practice and research.
The Education of a Physician-Scientist in a Combined  
MD-PhD Program
According to the AAMC Student Records System, about 89.25% of 2022-2023 graduates earned an MD-
only degree, about 2.86% earned a joint bachelor’s-MD degree, and 3.1% earned a joint MD-PhD degree.
CHAPTER 12
MD-PhD Programs 
112

Physician-scientists — those trained in both medicine and research — are greatly needed in today’s world. 
A synergy results when experimental thinking and clinical practice are joined, and that combination is  
found among those who have completed both MD and PhD programs. These individuals help translate 
the achievements of basic research into active clinical practice and, in doing so, strengthen the link 
between medical knowledge and research as they study, prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. If this is 
the path you prefer, you’ll enjoy a busy, challenging, and rewarding career.
Advantages of the MD-PhD Dual Degree
One route to a career as a physician-scientist is enrollment in a combined MD-PhD program. Although 
you can complete a PhD program before or after receiving your MD degree, there are several 
advantages to pursuing joint MD-PhD education:
 • The greatest advantage of the dual-degree program is the integration of research and clinical 
training. This integrated approach may include training opportunities across departments and 
interactions with teams of both basic scientists and clinical investigators.
 • You can save a significant amount of time. Most MD-PhD programs can be completed in 
seven or eight years, compared with the nine or more years it would take to earn both degrees 
independently.
 • Students in MD-PhD programs have access to opportunities for research and faculty mentoring 
to an extent frequently unavailable to MD-only students. As a result, these students are often 
able to enhance their mastery of the basic science needed to identify patients’ underlying 
clinical problems and, ultimately, use that information to develop improvements in diagnosis 
and treatment. To learn more about available programs and how to apply, see the information 
at MD-PhD Dual Degree Training .
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL FAIR — MD-PHD: IS IT RIGHT FOR YOU?
In this videocast, leaders of medical school MD-PhD programs describe undergraduate 
preparation and application processes and discuss training in MD-PhD programs and 
postgraduate career opportunities.
Paths to a Research Career
If you’re interested in a career in research, but you aren’t sure whether you want to pursue a dual 
MD-PhD degree, here are some other options you can explore:
 • PhD in biomedical sciences. You can earn a PhD in biomedical sciences in graduate programs 
at medical schools. Such programs typically include one or two years of core coursework, lab 
rotations to help you select a mentor in your chosen field of research, and three to four years of 
doctoral research. Learn more about available programs and how to apply on the AAMC website. 
 • MS degree or PhD in clinical investigation.  You might also consider graduate work leading 
to a master’s degree or PhD in clinical investigation. These programs, which you can pursue 
jointly or after receiving your MD degree, are offered at many medical schools and biomedical 
graduate schools throughout the United States.
 • Year-enrichment program. Another option is to take a year away from your MD program to conduct 
research under the direction of a mentor in a scholars’ program. Two such programs are the Fogarty 
Extramural Programs and the NIH Medical Research Scholars Program. In addition, many medical 
schools offer similar opportunities for their students.
113 | Chapter 12: MD-PhD Programs

Research Specialties
Like their PhD-only counterparts, people who hold a combined degree can pursue many scientific 
specialties. Most students earn their PhDs in biomedical disciplines such as biochemistry, 
biomedical engineering, biophysics, cell biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, 
neuroscience, and pharmacology.
It’s important to know, however, that not every research specialty is offered at every medical school 
and that curricula can vary from institution to institution. In some schools, for example, MD-PhD 
students complete their graduate work in the social sciences or humanities — fields of study 
outside laboratory disciplines — in areas such as anthropology, computational biology, economics, 
engineering, health care policy, mathematics, physics, and sociology.
To learn more, refer to the information in MD-PhD in the Social Sciences or Humanities: Is it Right 
for Me? You may also view a summary of MD-PhD programs that offer areas of study in social sciences, 
humanities, or other non-transitional fields of graduate study.
Clinical Specialties
MD-PhD students can pursue many clinical specialties. The clinical specialty choices of MD-PhD 
graduates over the past five years indicate strong interest in internal medicine, pathology, and 
pediatrics.
Compared with MD-only graduates, MD-PhD graduates are more likely to enter residencies in 
radiation oncology, child neurology, and pathology and less likely to go into family medicine, 
emergency medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology. The majority of dual-degree students enter research 
residency programs after graduation. A very small percentage of program graduates choose not to 
enter clinical residency and go straight into a research postdoctoral fellowship training.
The Typical Program
Almost all U.S. and Canadian medical schools have MD-PhD programs in one or more areas of 
specialization. (Visit the AAMC website to find a list of MD-PhD programs available at AAMC-
member medical schools.) Some programs are relatively small, with a total of a dozen or so 
students over eight years of training (one or two new students each year), while others are much 
larger, with a total enrollment of around 190 (up to 24 new students enrolled annually). The total 
number of MD-PhD matriculants in the United States in 2023 was 707, with 50.2% women and 
48.7% men, as shown in Table B-8: U.S. Medical School MD-PhD Applications and Matriculants by 
School, In-State Status, and Gender, 2023-2024.
Although programs differ, some core elements are common to almost all MD-PhD programs. The typical 
program takes seven to eight years to complete and includes:
 • Completion of the first two years of combined medical and graduate school coursework
 • Three to five years of doctoral research, including the completion of a thesis project
 • A return to medical school for core clinical training and electives during the final years of the 
medical curriculum
At most schools, integrated approaches to graduate and medical education have been introduced 
throughout the curriculum — quite extensively in some programs. In addition, most programs 
engage students in a wide range of other activities to enrich their training experience.
114 | Chapter 12: MD-PhD Programs

Residency Programs After Graduation
After medical school, most MD-PhD students transition to residencies just like a traditional medical 
student. A number of residency programs around the country offer highly structured programs 
in which research is fully integrated into clinical training. These programs differ in their overall 
composition but generally offer a shortened residency training period. For more information, see 
Career Paths for MD-PhD Graduates and Physician Scientist Training Programs (PSTPs).
Application and Admission
Nearly all MD-PhD programs participate in the American Medical College Application Service 
(AMCAS), described in Chapter 7.
If you choose to pursue a dual-degree program, you’ll designate yourself as a combined MD-PhD 
training applicant and complete two additional essays: one explaining why you are interested in 
the joint training program and the other describing your research experience. Specifics in the 
application process — and the prerequisites required for admission — vary from school to school. 
Some institutions, for example, require GRE scores. For complete information about a dual-degree 
program that interests you, review the program description at the medical school’s website.
WHERE PHYSICIAN-SCIENTISTS WORK
Nearly 80% of MD-PhD graduates who responded to a national survey are employed as 
faculty in academic medical centers or work at the NIH, at research institutes, in industry, 
or in federal agencies.
Factors Considered by Admissions Committees
Admissions committee members will review the application materials for the usual experiences, 
attributes, and metrics important for admitting students to MD-only programs (see Chapter 8). But 
because MD-PhD applicants plan to become both physicians and scientists, committee members 
will also look for evidence of an applicant’s passion and aptitude for research. They accomplish 
this largely through reviewing the applicant’s personal statement, which includes a description of 
research experiences and letters of evaluation from faculty or researchers with whom the applicant 
has worked. In particular, committee members seek confirmation of:
 • Relevant and substantive research experience during or after college
 • An appreciation for and understanding of the work of physician-scientists
 • Intellectual drive, research ability, and perseverance
If you hope to pursue the MD-PhD joint degree, you’ll be expected to have clinical experience — 
through volunteer work, shadowing a physician-scientist, or specific training. Other experiences 
that admissions committee members look for are similar to those of the MD-only candidate: 
leadership positions, community service activities, and teaching roles.
Finally, it’s important to be aware that although significant weight is placed on an applicant’s interest 
and experience in research activities, the applicant is also expected to demonstrate a degree of 
academic excellence similar to that of people accepted into an MD-only program. For students 
applying to enter MD-PhD programs in 2023, for example, the mean GPA and total MCAT score were 
3.70 and 511.1 respectively (as reported by AMCAS). Keep in mind, though, that the range of GPAs and 
MCAT scores for accepted applicants is quite broad in conjunction with other selection criteria.
115 | Chapter 12: MD-PhD Programs

Acceptance Policies
Just as application requirements vary from school to school, so do acceptance policies. Some 
institutions permit an applicant who is not accepted to the MD-PhD dual-degree program to 
pursue admission to the MD-only curriculum. Other medical schools will accept applications from 
MD-PhD candidates only for both degree programs together, and failure to gain admittance to 
one program precludes consideration from the other. Because school policies differ, clarify these 
matters with individual schools before applying, and let admissions office staff know of your 
interest in pursuing an MD-only program (if that is the case) should you not be admitted to the 
dual-degree program.
Financing MD-PhD Programs
The sources of funding for MD-PhD programs vary from school to school. Many schools offer 
full support for both the MD and PhD components of their education, including tuition waivers, 
stipends, and health insurance. At other institutions, different degrees of support are available, 
sometimes only for the PhD component of the program. Before applying to an MD-PhD 
dual-degree program, you should check with individual programs about the level of financial 
assistance available.
A significant amount of funding comes from institutional sources, as well as individual and 
institutional grants. The latter include the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) sponsored 
by the NIH, as well as other NIH grants. The MSTP currently has 51 participating programs with 
approximately 1,000 trainees. For more information about the program, see the NIH website.
You can review the list of medical schools participating in the MSTP . You may also want to contact 
the program officials at the institutions of interest and review school websites for complete 
information.
Bear in mind that, although most MD-PhD programs offer support for their students, additional 
resources are available. Most require competitive applications submitted by the trainee and 
a research mentor. Resources include fellowships from private sources and a number of NIH 
institutes. Review a list of these opportunities on the NIH’s Student Resources page.
Gap Year and Career Changers
If you have a significant break between earning your bachelor’s degree and applying to medical 
school, use some of that time to gain more research and medically related experience (such as 
working, shadowing, or volunteering in hospitals and clinics). This will help make you a competitive 
applicant — you can draw on that experience as you complete your medical school applications and 
interviews. However, if you already have significant research and medically related experience as an 
undergraduate and are ready to apply, a gap year is not recommended.
For more information about gaining research experience, refer to the Aspiring Docs® Fact Sheet, How 
to Get Research Experience.

University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine  
Class of 2027 
It is an unfortunate reality that admission into Canadian medical schools is 
notoriously challenging, demanding a combination of merit and a touch of 
luck. While many believe a traditional life sciences background is essential, 
this is no longer the case. Entry recommendations often supersede entry 
requirements now, paving the way for nontraditional paths.
In my case, I have a background in computer science, which is where my journey began. I chose to 
pursue medicine not because I was set on it from the start, but because while studying computer 
science, I stumbled into a newfound passion for integrating modern technologies with health 
care. Inherently, we as people are multidimensional, with ever-evolving passions and interests that 
lead us down diverse paths. And to this day, I maintain my interest in both computer science and 
medicine, finding ways to integrate the two fields in both my studies and research. Unequivocally, 
my decision to transition into medicine was not a departure from my original interests, but rather 
an expansion of them.
I truly believe that my journey reflects a broader trend within Canadian medical schools to 
embrace varied backgrounds, both academic and non-academic, recognizing that students 
can acquire the necessary knowledge and skills through nontraditional paths.  So, to all the 
potential applicants out there, I encourage you to explore based on your interests rather than your 
perception of the “right” path. By doing so, you will empower yourself with unique opportunities 
and invaluable perspectives that will enrich not only your medical education, but also the medical 
community as a whole. 
Selection Criteria
Canadian medical schools vary with respect to the number of years of undergraduate instruction 
they require of applicants. They also vary in the recommended content covered during premedical 
undergraduate education. Table 14.1 shows that physics, inorganic and organic chemistry, biology, 
biochemistry, humanities, and English are the most commonly required subjects.
Language of Instruction
Three Canadian medical schools — Laval, Montréal, and Sherbrooke — are all located in the 
province of Québec and require students to be fluent in French because all instruction is in that 
language. Instruction at 13 other Canadian schools is in English, and the University of Ottawa offers 
the MD curriculum in both French and English.
CHAPTER 14
Canadian Medical Schools

In Canada, universities fall under provincial jurisdiction, and 
the majority of student spots in each faculty of medicine are 
allocated to permanent residents of the province in which the 
university is located.
Not all faculties of medicine accept applications from 
international students. Conversely, some faculties of medicine 
may reserve positions for international students, possibly as 
part of agreements with foreign governments and institutions. 
Statistics compiled by the Association of Faculties of Medicine 
of Canada show that most medical schools admit international 
students. In 2022-2023, for example, 68 U.S. students applied 
to 11 schools in Canada, with 1.5% of those students being 
accepted and 3.0% being offered acceptance, according to 
the Canadian medical schools that supplied data. In the same 
year, 296 non-U.S. international students applied to the nine 
Canadian medical schools that supplied data, and their success 
rate was 2.0%. The success rate for Canadian applicants to 
the same schools was 15.1%. Additional information about 
Canadian medical schools can be found in the Association of 
Faculties of Medicine of Canada 2025 publication of Admission 
Requirements of Canadian Faculties of Medicine .
Positions filled by international students in Canadian medical 
schools are not necessarily subsidized by provincial or territorial governments. This means that 
international students, including U.S. students, may pay higher tuition and fees than Canadian 
residents.
Academic Record and Suitability
Although an excellent academic record is a very important factor in gaining admission to a 
Canadian medical school, admissions committees also put a great deal of effort into assessing 
applicants’ suitability for a medical career based on other factors, too. Personal suitability is assessed 
differently by each school, but in general, applicants who can demonstrate they possess the qualities 
considered important in the practice of medicine may sometimes be admitted even without an 
outstanding academic record. Conversely, applicants with outstanding records who don’t possess these 
qualities may not gain a place in medical school.
Most applicants to Canadian medical schools are interviewed before acceptance, so the interview 
information in Chapter 8 is also relevant.
MCAT
Twelve of the 17 Canadian medical schools require applicants to take the MCAT exam: Alberta, 
British Columbia, Calgary, Dalhousie, Manitoba, McMaster, Memorial, Queen’s, Saskatchewan, 
Toronto, and Western Ontario. The MCAT exam is required by McGill for applications from non-
Canadian universities.
Tuition and Other Compulsory Fees
Because the medical schools in Canada fall under the jurisdiction of provincial governments, annual 
tuition and compulsory fees vary considerably. Applicants who reside in the province where the 
medical school is located may pay annual fees ranging from $3,729 to $26,652, with an average

of $17,446 (refer to Table 14.2). Applicants who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents in a 
different province may pay fees ranging from $8,360 to $26,652, with an average of $18,621; foreign 
student applicants can expect to pay fees ranging from $28,615 to $91,760, with an average of $46,138.

Other Considerations
Canadian faculties of medicine do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or gender in admitting 
new students. The admission of aboriginal students (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) is encouraged at 
Canadian medical schools, and most schools allocate positions specifically for aboriginal applicants, 
including, Laval, Sherbrooke, Montréal, McGill, Ottawa, Queen’s, McMaster, Western Ontario, Northern 
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.
The number of female applicants has leveled off in recent years, with correspondingly consistent 
proportions of women in schools’ entering classes. Women have made up approximately 61.3% of the 
applicant pool for the past five years, and the success rate for women is slightly higher than that for 
men. Overall, 15.1% of applicants received at least one offer of admission.
Expenses and Financial Aid
Tuition and student fees for Canadian and non-Canadian students in the 2023 entering class are 
provided in Table 14.2 and in individual medical school entries on the MSAR website. Expenses vary 
from school to school and from student to student. Tuition at several Canadian schools is slightly 
higher for the first year than for successive years. Some financial aid information is provided in the 
individual school entries. Eligible Canadian students may apply for a Canadian student loan, or they 
may apply to the Department of Education in their province for a provincial student loan.
